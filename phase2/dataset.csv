"Deep Learning - Foundations and Concepts "" Deep Learning is Springer Nature’s bestselling book of 2024, cementing its position as a cornerstone resource in the field of artificial intelligence."" - Springer Nature New: corrections to the first printing Solutions to exercises for chapters 2 to 10 available for download This book offers a comprehensive introduction to the central ideas that underpin deep learning. It is intended both for newcomers to machine learning and for those already experienced in the field. Covering key concepts relating to contemporary architectures and techniques, this essential book equips readers with a robust foundation for potential future specialization. The field of deep learning is undergoing rapid evolution, and therefore this book focusses on ideas that are likely to endure the test of time. The book is organized into numerous bite-sized chapters, each exploring a distinct topic, and the narrative follows a linear progression, with each chapter building upon content from its predecessors. This structure is well-suited to teaching a two-semester undergraduate or postgraduate machine learning course, while remaining equally relevant to those engaged in active research or in self-study. A full understanding of machine learning requires some mathematical background and so the book includes a self-contained introduction to probability theory. However, the focus of the book is on conveying a clear understanding of ideas, with emphasis on the real-world practical value of techniques rather than on abstract theory. Complex concepts are therefore presented from multiple complementary perspectives including textual descriptions, diagrams, mathematical formulae, and pseudo-code. A complete set of figures available for download Interview with Machine Learning Street Talk (MLST) Chris Bishop is a Technical Fellow at Microsoft and is the Director of Microsoft Research AI4Science. He is a Fellow of Darwin College Cambridge, a Fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering, and a Fellow of the Royal Society. Hugh Bishop is an Applied Scientist at Wayve, a deep learning autonomous driving company in London where he designs and trains deep neural networks. He completed his MPhil in Machine Learning and Machine Intelligence at Cambridge University. How to access the book: Hardback copies can be purchased from online stores such as Amazon. If you like the book, please leave a positive review. Unlike most books, the hardback edition is produced using stitched signatures so that the book lays flat when opened, along with offset printing on coated paper stock for the highest quality product. A PDF-based eBook is available for purchase from Springer . A free-to-use online version is available below: Chris Bishop wrote a terrific textbook on neural networks in 1995 and has a deep knowledge of the field and its core ideas. His many years of experience in explaining neural networks have made him extremely skilful at presenting complicated ideas in the simplest possible way and it is a delight to see these skills applied to the revolutionary new developments in the field. - Geoffrey Hinton With the recent explosion of deep learning and Al as a research topic, and the quickly growing importance of Al applications, a modern textbook on the topic was badly needed. The ""New Bishop"" masterfully fills the gap, covering algorithms for supervised and unsupervised learning, along with modern deep learning architecture families, as well as how to apply all of this to various application areas. - Yann LeCun This excellent and very educational book will bring the reader up to date with the main concepts and advances in deep learning with a solid anchoring in probability. These concepts are powering current industrial Al systems and are likely to form the basis of further advances towards artificial general intelligence. - Yoshua Bengio Feedback We welcome your comments to feedback@bishopbook.com Coming Soon Worked solutions to exercises","1"

as our running example. The network will have four parameters, and will be trained with
gradient descent to fit random data by minimizing the Euclidean distance
between the network output and the true output. Note You can browse the individual examples at the end of this page .

numpy. Numpy provides an n-dimensional array object, and many functions for
manipulating these arrays. Numpy is a generic framework for scientific
computing; it does not know anything about computation graphs, or deep
learning, or gradients. However we can easily use numpy to fit a
third order polynomial to sine function by manually implementing the forward
and backward passes through the network using numpy operations: # -*- coding: utf-8 -*- import numpy as np import math # Create random input and output data x = np . linspace ( - math . pi , math . pi , 2000 ) y = np . sin ( x ) # Randomly initialize weights a = np . random . randn () b = np . random . randn () c = np . random . randn () d = np . random . randn () learning_rate = 1e-6 for t in range ( 2000 ): # Forward pass: compute predicted y # y = a + b x + c x^2 + d x^3 y_pred = a + b * x + c * x ** 2 + d * x ** 3 # Compute and print loss loss = np . square ( y_pred - y ) . sum () if t % 100 == 99 : print ( t , loss ) # Backprop to compute gradients of a, b, c, d with respect to loss grad_y_pred = 2.0 * ( y_pred - y ) grad_a = grad_y_pred . sum () grad_b = ( grad_y_pred * x ) . sum () grad_c = ( grad_y_pred * x ** 2 ) . sum () grad_d = ( grad_y_pred * x ** 3 ) . sum () # Update weights a -= learning_rate * grad_a b -= learning_rate * grad_b c -= learning_rate * grad_c d -= learning_rate * grad_d print ( f 'Result: y = { a } + { b } x + { c } x^2 + { d } x^3' ) PyTorch: Tensors # Numpy is a great framework, but it cannot utilize GPUs to accelerate its
numerical computations. For modern deep neural networks, GPUs often
provide speedups of 50x or greater , so
unfortunately numpy won’t be enough for modern deep learning. Here we introduce the most fundamental PyTorch concept: the Tensor .
A PyTorch Tensor is conceptually identical to a numpy array: a Tensor is
an n-dimensional array, and PyTorch provides many functions for
operating on these Tensors. Behind the scenes, Tensors can keep track of
a computational graph and gradients, but they’re also useful as a
generic tool for scientific computing. Also unlike numpy, PyTorch Tensors can utilize GPUs to accelerate
their numeric computations. To run a PyTorch Tensor on GPU, you simply
need to specify the correct device. Here we use PyTorch Tensors to fit a third order polynomial to sine function.
Like the numpy example above we need to manually implement the forward
and backward passes through the network: # -*- coding: utf-8 -*- import torch import math dtype = torch . float device = torch . device ( ""cpu"" ) # device = torch.device(""cuda:0"") # Uncomment this to run on GPU # Create random input and output data x = torch . linspace ( - math . pi , math . pi , 2000 , device = device , dtype = dtype ) y = torch . sin ( x ) # Randomly initialize weights a = torch . randn ((), device = device , dtype = dtype ) b = torch . randn ((), device = device , dtype = dtype ) c = torch . randn ((), device = device , dtype = dtype ) d = torch . randn ((), device = device , dtype = dtype ) learning_rate = 1e-6 for t in range ( 2000 ): # Forward pass: compute predicted y y_pred = a + b * x + c * x ** 2 + d * x ** 3 # Compute and print loss loss = ( y_pred - y ) . pow ( 2 ) . sum () . item () if t % 100 == 99 : print ( t , loss ) # Backprop to compute gradients of a, b, c, d with respect to loss grad_y_pred = 2.0 * ( y_pred - y ) grad_a = grad_y_pred . sum () grad_b = ( grad_y_pred * x ) . sum () grad_c = ( grad_y_pred * x ** 2 ) . sum () grad_d = ( grad_y_pred * x ** 3 ) . sum () # Update weights using gradient descent a -= learning_rate * grad_a b -= learning_rate * grad_b c -= learning_rate * grad_c d -= learning_rate * grad_d print ( f 'Result: y = { a . item () } + { b . item () } x + { c . item () } x^2 + { d . item () } x^3' ) Autograd # PyTorch: Tensors and autograd # In the above examples, we had to manually implement both the forward and
backward passes of our neural network. Manually implementing the
backward pass is not a big deal for a small two-layer network, but can
quickly get very hairy for large complex networks. Thankfully, we can use automatic
differentiation to automate the computation of backward passes in neural networks. The autograd package in PyTorch provides exactly this functionality.
When using autograd, the forward pass of your network will define a computational graph ; nodes in the graph will be Tensors, and edges
will be functions that produce output Tensors from input Tensors.
Backpropagating through this graph then allows you to easily compute
gradients. This sounds complicated, it’s pretty simple to use in practice. Each Tensor
represents a node in a computational graph. If x is a Tensor that has x.requires_grad=True then x.grad is another Tensor holding the
gradient of x with respect to some scalar value. Here we use PyTorch Tensors and autograd to implement our fitting sine wave
with third order polynomial example; now we no longer need to manually
implement the backward pass through the network: import torch import math # We want to be able to train our model on an `accelerator <https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/torch.html#accelerators>`__ # such as CUDA, MPS, MTIA, or XPU.

that operate on Tensors. The forward function computes output
Tensors from input Tensors. The backward function receives the
gradient of the output Tensors with respect to some scalar value, and
computes the gradient of the input Tensors with respect to that same
scalar value. In PyTorch we can easily define our own autograd operator by defining a
subclass of torch.autograd.Function and implementing the forward and backward functions. We can then use our new autograd operator by
constructing an instance and calling it like a function, passing
Tensors containing input data. In this example we define our model as \(y=a+b P_3(c+dx)\) instead of \(y=a+bx+cx^2+dx^3\) , where \(P_3(x)=\frac{1}{2}\left(5x^3-3x\right)\) is the Legendre polynomial of degree three. We write our own custom autograd
function for computing forward and backward of \(P_3\) , and use it to implement
our model: import torch import math class LegendrePolynomial3 ( torch . autograd . Function ): """""" We can implement our own custom autograd Functions by subclassing torch.autograd.Function and implementing the forward and backward passes which operate on Tensors. """""" @staticmethod def forward ( ctx , input ): """""" In the forward pass we receive a Tensor containing the input and return a Tensor containing the output. ctx is a context object that can be used to stash information for backward computation.

defining complex operators and automatically taking derivatives; however
for large neural networks raw autograd can be a bit too low-level. When building neural networks we frequently think of arranging the
computation into layers , some of which have learnable parameters which will be optimized during learning. In TensorFlow, packages like Keras , TensorFlow-Slim ,
and TFLearn provide higher-level abstractions
over raw computational graphs that are useful for building neural
networks. In PyTorch, the nn package serves this same purpose. The nn package defines a set of Modules , which are roughly equivalent to
neural network layers. A Module receives input Tensors and computes
output Tensors, but may also hold internal state such as Tensors
containing learnable parameters. The nn package also defines a set
of useful loss functions that are commonly used when training neural
networks. In this example we use the nn package to implement our polynomial model
network: # -*- coding: utf-8 -*- import torch import math # Create Tensors to hold input and outputs. x = torch . linspace ( - math . pi , math . pi , 2000 ) y = torch . sin ( x ) # For this example, the output y is a linear function of (x, x^2, x^3), so # we can consider it as a linear layer neural network.

The Linear Module computes output from input using a # linear function, and holds internal Tensors for its weight and bias. # The Flatten layer flatens the output of the linear layer to a 1D tensor, # to match the shape of `y`. model = torch . nn . Sequential ( torch . nn . Linear ( 3 , 1 ), torch . nn .

MSELoss ( reduction = 'sum' ) learning_rate = 1e-6 for t in range ( 2000 ): # Forward pass: compute predicted y by passing x to the model.

When # doing so you pass a Tensor of input data to the Module and it produces # a Tensor of output data. y_pred = model ( xx ) # Compute and print loss.

mutating the Tensors holding learnable parameters with torch.no_grad() .
This is not a huge burden for simple optimization algorithms like stochastic
gradient descent, but in practice we often train neural networks using more
sophisticated optimizers like AdaGrad , RMSProp , Adam , and other. The optim package in PyTorch abstracts the idea of an optimization
algorithm and provides implementations of commonly used optimization
algorithms. In this example we will use the nn package to define our model as
before, but we will optimize the model using the RMSprop algorithm provided
by the optim package: # -*- coding: utf-8 -*- import torch import math # Create Tensors to hold input and outputs. x = torch . linspace ( - math . pi , math . pi , 2000 ) y = torch . sin ( x ) # Prepare the input tensor (x, x^2, x^3). p = torch . tensor ([ 1 , 2 , 3 ]) xx = x . unsqueeze ( - 1 ) . pow ( p ) # Use the nn package to define our model and loss function. model = torch . nn .

MSELoss ( reduction = 'sum' ) # Use the optim package to define an Optimizer that will update the weights of # the model for us.

This is because by default, gradients are # accumulated in buffers( i.e, not overwritten) whenever .backward() # is called. Checkout docs of torch.autograd.backward for more details. optimizer . zero_grad () # Backward pass: compute gradient of the loss with respect to model # parameters loss . backward () # Calling the step function on an Optimizer makes an update to its # parameters optimizer . step () linear_layer = model [ 0 ] print ( f 'Result: y = { linear_layer . bias . item () } + { linear_layer . weight [:, 0 ] . item () } x + { linear_layer . weight [:, 1 ] . item () } x^2 + { linear_layer . weight [:, 2 ] . item () } x^3' ) PyTorch: Custom nn Modules # Sometimes you will want to specify models that are more complex than a
sequence of existing Modules; for these cases you can define your own
Modules by subclassing nn.Module and defining a forward which
receives input Tensors and produces output Tensors using other
modules or other autograd operations on Tensors. In this example we implement our third order polynomial as a custom Module
subclass: # -*- coding: utf-8 -*- import torch import math class Polynomial3 ( torch . nn .

strange model: a third-fifth order polynomial that on each forward pass
chooses a random number between 3 and 5 and uses that many orders, reusing
the same weights multiple times to compute the fourth and fifth order. For this model we can use normal Python flow control to implement the loop,
and we can implement weight sharing by simply reusing the same parameter multiple
times when defining the forward pass. We can easily implement this model as a Module subclass: # -*- coding: utf-8 -*- import random import torch import math class DynamicNet ( torch . nn . Module ): def __init__ ( self ): """""" In the constructor we instantiate five parameters and assign them as members. """""" super () . __init__ () self . a = torch . nn . Parameter ( torch . randn (())) self . b = torch . nn . Parameter ( torch . randn (())) self . c = torch . nn . Parameter ( torch . randn (())) self . d = torch . nn . Parameter ( torch . randn (())) self . e = torch . nn . Parameter ( torch . randn (())) def forward ( self , x ): """""" For the forward pass of the model, we randomly choose either 4, 5 and reuse the e parameter to compute the contribution of these orders. Since each forward pass builds a dynamic computation graph, we can use normal Python control-flow operators like loops or conditional statements when defining the forward pass of the model. Here we also see that it is perfectly safe to reuse the same parameter many times when defining a computational graph. """""" y = self . a + self . b * x + self . c * x ** 2 + self . d * x ** 3 for exp in range ( 4 , random . randint ( 4 , 6 )): y = y + self . e * x ** exp return y def string ( self ): """""" Just like any class in Python, you can also define custom method on PyTorch modules """""" return f 'y = { self . a . item () } + { self . b . item () } x + { self . c . item () } x^2 + { self . d . item () } x^3 + { self . e . item () } x^4 ? + { self . e . item () } x^5 ?' # Create Tensors to hold input and outputs. x = torch . linspace ( - math . pi , math . pi , 2000 ) y = torch . sin ( x ) # Construct our model by instantiating the class defined above model = DynamicNet () # Construct our loss function and an Optimizer.

In simple words, ML teaches the systems to think and understand like humans by learning from the data. Try our ongoing free course Data Science Skillup with weekly topic coverage, notes, daily quizzes and coding problems. Machine Learning is mainly divided into three core types: Supervised, Unsupervised and Reinforcement Learning along with two additional types, Semi-Supervised and Self-Supervised Learning. Supervised Learning : Trains models on labeled data to predict or classify new, unseen data. Unsupervised Learning : Finds patterns or groups in unlabeled data, like clustering or dimensionality reduction. Reinforcement Learning : Learns through trial and error to maximize rewards, ideal for decision-making tasks. Note: The following are not part of the original three core types of ML, but they have become increasingly important in real-world applications, especially in deep learning. Additional Types : Self-Supervised Learning : Self-supervised learning is often considered as a  subset of unsupervised learning, but it has grown into its own field due to its success in training large-scale models. It generates its own labels from the data, without any manual labeling. Semi-Supervised Learning : This approach combines a small amount of labeled data with a large amount of unlabeled data. It’s useful when labeling data is expensive or time-consuming. Module 1: Machine Learning Pipeline This section covers preprocessing, exploratory data analysis and model evaluation to prepare data, uncover insights and build reliable models. 1. Data Preprocessing ML workflow Data Cleaning Data Preprocessing in Python Feature Scaling Feature Extraction Feature Engineering Feature Selection Techniques 2. Exploratory Data Analysis Exploratory Data Analysis Exploratory Data Analysis in Python Advance EDA Time Series Data Visualization 3. Model Evaluation Regularization in Machine Learning Confusion Matrix Precision, Recall and F1-Score AUC-ROC Curve Cross-validation Hyperparameter Tuning Module 2: Supervised Learning Supervised learning algorithms are generally categorized into two main types: Classification - where the goal is to predict discrete labels or categories Regression - where the aim is to predict continuous numerical values. Supervised Learning There are many algorithms used in supervised learning each suited to different types of problems. Some of the most commonly used supervised learning algorithms are: 1. Linear Regression This is one of the simplest ways to predict numbers using a straight line. It helps find the relationship between input and output. Introduction to Linear Regression Gradient Descent in Linear Regression Multiple Linear Regression 2. Logistic Regression Used when the output is a ""yes or no"" type answer. It helps in predicting categories like pass/fail or spam/not spam. Understanding Logistic Regression Cost function in Logistic Regression 3. Decision Trees A model that makes decisions by asking a series of simple questions, like a flowchart. Easy to understand and use. Decision Tree in Machine Learning Types of Decision tree algorithms Decision Tree - Regression (Implementation) Decision tree - Classification (Implementation) 4. Support Vector Machines (SVM) A bit more advanced—it tries to draw the best line (or boundary) to separate different categories of data. Understanding SVMs SVM Hyperparameter Tuning - GridSearchCV Non-Linear SVM 5. k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) This model looks at the closest data points (neighbors) to make predictions. Super simple and based on similarity. Introduction to KNN Decision Boundaries in K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) 6. Naïve Bayes A quick and smart way to classify things based on probability. It works well for text and spam detection. Introduction to Naive Bayes Gaussian Naive Bayes Multinomial Naive Bayes Bernoulli Naive Bayes Complement Naive Bayes 7. Random Forest (Bagging Algorithm) A powerful model that builds lots of decision trees and combines them for better accuracy and stability. Introduction to Random forest Random Forest Classifier Random Forest Regression Hyperparameter Tuning in Random Forest Introduction to Ensemble Learning Ensemble learning combines multiple simple models to create a stronger, smarter model. There are mainly two types of ensemble learning: Bagging that combines multiple models trained independently. Boosting that builds models sequentially each correcting the errors of the previous one. Module 3: Unsupervised learning Unsupervised learning are again divided into three main categories based on their purpose: Clustering Association Rule Mining Dimensionality Reduction . Unsupervised learning 1. Clustering Clustering algorithms group data points into clusters based on their similarities or differences. Types of clustering algorithms are: Centroid-based Methods: K-Means clustering Elbow Method for optimal value of k in KMeans K-Means++ clustering K-Mode clustering Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) Clustering Distribution-based Methods : Gaussian mixture models Expectation-Maximization Algorithm Dirichlet process mixture models (DPMMs) Connectivity based methods: Hierarchical clustering Agglomerative Clustering Divisive clustering Affinity propagation Density Based methods: DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) OPTICS (Ordering Points To Identify the Clustering Structure) 2. Dimensionality Reduction Dimensionality reduction is used to simplify datasets by reducing the number of features while retaining the most important information. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) Independent Component Analysis (ICA) Isomap Locally Linear Embedding (LLE) 3. Association Rule Find patterns between items in large datasets typically in market basket analysis . Apriori algorithm Implementing apriori algorithm FP-Growth (Frequent Pattern-Growth) ECLAT (Equivalence Class Clustering and bottom-up Lattice Traversal) Module 4: Reinforcement Learning Reinforcement learning interacts with environment and learn from them based on rewards. Reinforcement Learning 1. Model-Based Methods These methods use a model of the environment to predict outcomes and help the agent plan actions by simulating potential results. Markov decision processes (MDPs) Bellman equation Value iteration algorithm Monte Carlo Tree Search 2. Model-Free Methods The agent learns directly from experience by interacting with the environment and adjusting its actions based on feedback. Q-Learning SARSA Monte Carlo Methods Reinforce Algorithm Actor-Critic Algorithm Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic (A3C) Module 5: Semi Supervised Learning It uses a mix of labeled and unlabeled data making it helpful when labeling data is costly or it is very limited. Semi Supervised Learning Semi Supervised Classification Self-Training in Semi-Supervised Learning Few-shot learning in Machine Learning Module 6: Forecasting Models Forecasting models analyze past data to predict future trends, commonly used for time series problems like sales, demand or stock prices. ARIMA (Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average) SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA) Exponential Smoothing (Holt-Winters) Module 7: Deployment of ML Models The trained ML model must be integrated into an application or service to make its predictions accessible. Machine learning deployement Deploy ML Model using Streamlit Library Deploy ML web app on Heroku Create UIs for prototyping Machine Learning model with Gradio APIs allow other applications or systems to access the ML model's functionality and integrate them into larger workflows. Deploy Machine Learning Model using Flask Deploying ML Models as API using FastAPI MLOps ensure they are deployed, monitored and maintained efficiently in real-world production systems.

Get your team access to the full DataCamp for business platform. For Business For a bespoke solution book a demo . Machine learning practitioners and software engineers typically turn to frameworks to alleviate some of the heavy lifting involved with programming. For example, machine learning frameworks allow practitioners to implement models without needing to dig deep into the mathematical underpinnings of the algorithms. This streamlines the development process for programmers since they aren’t required to consistently rewrite code to build their applications. These concepts also apply to deep learning — a subset of machine learning. TensorFlow, Keras, and PyTorch are three of the most popular deep learning frameworks. In this tutorial, we will explore each one and develop a rough solution to help you decide which one is right for you to use for your project. What is TensorFlow? TensorFlow is an end-to-end deep learning framework. It was developed by the Google Brain team, initially for internal use at Google for research and production; however, it was made open-source in 2015 under the Apache License. In September 2019, a new updated version of TensorFlow was released by Google under the name TensorFlow 2.0. You can explore the framework in more detail in our TensorFlow tutorial . Some of the key features of TensorFlow include: TensorBoard . A visualization toolset for TensorFlow that aids in understanding, debugging, and optimizing TensorFlow programs. Feature columns . High-level abstractions that transform raw data into formats suitable for machine learning models, simplifying the handling of diverse data types. Easily trainable on CPU and GPU . TensorFlow can train models on various hardware types, including CPUs and GPUs, enabling flexible and efficient computations. Parallel training . TensorFlow supports distributed computing, allowing simultaneous processing of data and models across multiple CPUs or GPUs, significantly speeding up training times. Pros of Tensorflow Open-source TensorFlow is an open-source framework, which means it is free of cost and can be used by anyone without having to lock into a contract with a vendor beforehand. Debugging One of TensorFlow’s key features is TensorBoard. TensorBoard is what provides the visualization and tooling required for experimentation in TensorBoard provides the visualization and tooling needed for machine learning experimentation in deep learning, which makes it much easier to debug your TensorFlow code. Keras compatibility When Google announced the release of TensorFlow 2.0, they also declared Keras to be the official high-level API of TensorFlow. This allows users to add high-level functionality to their code and reap the benefits of Keras’ simplicity. Scalability TensorFlow is not limited to a single device. Users may develop systems using the framework and expect it to work as efficiently on edge devices as it works on any other complex machine. Compatibility The framework is compatible with several programming languages; thus, users can work in the programming language they are most comfortable with. TensorFlow offers a reliable API for Python, along with APIs for Javascript, C++, and Java that do not guarantee backward compatibility. Additionally, there are third-party packages that provide language bindings for C#, Haskell, Julia, MATLAB, Object Pascal, R, Scala, Rust, OCaml, and Crystal. Parallelism TensorFlow is seen as a hardware acceleration library. The framework uses different distribution strategies in GPU and CPU systems. This means a user is free to use whatever architecture they would like to use. Note the system defaults to GPU if not mentioned explicitly; this process reduces memory usage to some extent. Disadvantages of Tensorflow Frequent updates Overhead for a user to install and bind TensorFlow to their existing system is increased due to frequent updates Inconsistent homonyms TensorFlow offers homonyms, which are challenging to comprehend and use since they have identical names but different implementations. For example, the tf.nn.conv2d and tf.layers.Conv2d have the same name, but they have slightly different settings, which can alter your outputs. Missing symbolic loops TensorFlow is referred to as a low-level API — and for good reason. The framework does not automatically handle iterations that result in symbolic loops. However, it does have usage for definite sequences, thereby making it a usable system. Limited GPU support The framework only supports NVIDIA and Python for GPU programming. There is no additional support. Low implementation speed Across all hardware configurations, TensorFlow consistently requires the most time to train various kinds of neural networks compared to its competitors. What is Keras? Keras is a popular open-source high-level neural network API developed by François Chollet and released in 2015. The documentation refers to it as, “an API designed for human beings, not machines.” In mid-2017, the framework was adopted and integrated into TensorFlow, making it accessible to TensorFlow users through the tf.keras module. However, it’s still possible to operate Keras independently of TensorFlow – check out this Keras cheat sheet or our full Keras tutorial . Here’s more from the documentation: “Keras focuses on debugging speed, code elegance & conciseness, maintainability, and deployability. When you choose Keras, your codebase is smaller, more readable, easier to iterate on. Your models run faster thanks to XLA compilation and Autograph optimizations and are easier to deploy across every surface (server, mobile, browser, embedded) thanks to TF Serving, TF Lite, and TF.js.” Pros of Keras Simplicity Keras has an extremely simple, user-friendly API, which contributes to it being easy to learn and get started with deep learning. Backend support Low-level computations are not used by Keras to function — the framework is built on top of Microsoft CNTK, Theano, and TensorFlow. Therefore it encourages the employment of backends. Pre-trained models A pre-trained model is a model that’s been saved after previously being trained on a large dataset. Keras provides several pre-trained models out of the box. Fast experimentation Keras is a high-level API; this means it’s fairly abstracted and more generic. Therefore, users can rapidly build models in a few lines of code. Community support Keras is an open-source platform and has a large community of active researchers and developers who contribute to support one another. Clear documentation The Keras documentation is filled with coded examples, making it simple for users to quickly grasp framework concepts. Cons of Keras Some improvable deatures Several practitioners have agreed Keras lacks a bit in the feature department, and there’s plenty of space for improvement. One such example is that the framework does not support dynamic chart creation. Inefficient errors The Keras library's error messages are ineffective. There is a requirement that the faults be clearly visible. Finding the error's primary cause is not all that useful or helpful. Keras requires a lot of debugging. High-level API Keras is a high-level API. Therefore, you have much less control over manipulating functions. What is PyTorch? PyTorch is the newest deep learning framework of the bunch. Developed by Facebook’s (now Meta) AI research group and open-sourced in 2016, PyTorch is now part of the Linux Foundation umbrella. Over the years, PyTorch has built a reputation as a framework of simplicity, flexibility, and efficiency. It enables developers to rapidly build complex neural networks for applications such as computer vision and natural language processing . Some of its key features include: Tensor computation . PyTorch provides a multi-dimensional array called Tensor, similar to NumPy's ndarray, but it can run on GPUs for faster computation. TorchScript . A way to serialize PyTorch models, allowing them to run in other environments like C++, ensuring production readiness. Dynamic graph computation . PyTorch uses dynamic computational graphs, enabling flexibility in building and modifying models on the fly, which is beneficial for complex architectures. Automatic differentiation . Automatic differentiation and gradient computation help simplify backpropagation and training of neural networks. Python support . PyTorch integrates seamlessly with the Python ecosystem, making it easier to use with Python libraries and providing a more Pythonic and user-friendly interface. Pros of PyTorch Pythonic PyTorch is Pythonic in nature, which makes it quite straightforward for Python developers to adopt. This feature is a pro because a large portion of deep learning work is done in Python. Easily to learn The PyTorch syntax is extremely simple and intuitive. Practitioners typically credit PyTorch as having a simple learning curve — some say it’s one of the easiest deep learning packages to learn. Easy to debug PyTorch is capable of utilizing Python's pdb and ipdb debugging tools. Programmers may also use PyCharm, the Python IDE, for debugging as PyTorch creates a computational graph in real-time. Strong community Despite being one of the newer deep learning frameworks, PyTorch has been able to develop a dedicated community of developers quite rapidly. These people work extremely hard to ensure the documentation is well-structured and insightful for other developers. Data parallelism PyTorch’s data parallelism is extremely effective as it enables users to split data into batches and send them to various GPUs for processing. By employing this method, PyTorch is able to transfer a sizable portion of the workload from the CPU to the GPU. Cons of PyTorch No data visualization TensorBoard by TensorFlow enables practitioners to visualize the training process, but there is nothing like this in PyTorch — users are required to use a third-party tool. API server needed for production There is no framework to provide models directly on the web; thus, you are required to use a third-party backend server like Flask or Django. Which to Choose? A Comparative Analysis of PyTorch vs Keras vs TensorFlow TensorFlow PyTorch Keras API Level Both (High and Low) Low High Architecture Not easy to use Complex, less readable Simple, concise, readable Datasets Large datasets, high-performance Large datasets, high-performance Smaller datasets Debugging Difficult to conduct debugging Good debugging capabilities Simple network, so debugging is not often needed Pretrained models? Yes Yes Yes Popularity Second most popular of the three Third most popular of the three Most popular of the three Speed Fast, high-performance Fast, high-performance Slow, low performance Written In C++, CUDA, Python Lua Python Choosing the Right Framework The answer to “which framework is better?” is always going to be subjective since each framework has pros and cons, as we’ve seen. However, here’s a list of things to consider when deciding on a framework. Pytorch vs TensorFlow Boilerplate code . Both PyTorch and TensorFlow simplify model construction by eliminating much of the boilerplate code. Pythonic and OOP . PyTorch is more ""Pythonic"" and adheres to object-oriented programming principles, making it intuitive for Python developers. Popularity . TensorFlow, being older and backed by Google, has a larger user base and community support. Flexibility . PyTorch offers more flexibility due to its use of dynamic computation graphs, allowing on-the-fly changes. Debugging and Tracking . TensorFlow's TensorBoard provides powerful visualization tools for debugging and tracking the training process. Serving framework . TensorFlow has a more mature serving system for deploying models, making it more seamless than PyTorch's deployment process. PyTorch vs Keras Learning curve . Both PyTorch and Keras are user-friendly, making them easy to learn and use. Research vs development . PyTorch is often preferred by researchers due to its flexibility and control, while Keras is favored by developers for its simplicity and plug-and-play qualities. Speed and debugging . PyTorch is generally faster and provides superior debugging capabilities compared to Keras. Tutorials and small datasets . Keras shines with its extensive, reusable code tutorials and is particularly effective when working with small datasets. TensorFlow vs Keras High-Level APIs . Both TensorFlow and Keras provide high-level APIs for building and training models. Pythonic nature . Keras, being built in Python, is more user-friendly and intuitive. Large datasets . TensorFlow is often preferred for handling large datasets due to its robustness and scalability. Wrapper . Keras acts as a wrapper to TensorFlow functions, simplifying the TensorFlow interface for ease of use. Conclusion TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Keras are three of the most popular deep learning frameworks. Each has its own unique qualities, which makes them great tools for certain areas.

Products Azure Azure AI Services Azure Cosmos DB Read the story Back to SUCCESS STORIES section Frequently asked questions Expand all Collapse all 01/ What is generative AI? How is it different from other types of AI? Generative AI uses deep learning to create new content in response to natural language prompts. It can also generate text, images, music, and code. There are several types of AI, each designed for different purposes: Traditional AI - Automates specific tasks using predefined rules and algorithms, often used in manufacturing and data processing. Predictive AI - Analyzes historical data to forecast future outcomes, commonly used in finance, healthcare, and marketing. Conversational AI - Powers chatbots and virtual assistants to facilitate natural language interactions, generating human-like responses. Generative AI is different because it creates content rather than simply analyzing or predicting based on existing data. See AI solutions 02/ What is a Copilot? Copilots are chat-based generative AI interactions from Microsoft. They have specialized functionality based on their users and use cases. Some Copilots are experienced standalone, while others are integrated into Microsoft products, services, and devices. Included in this portfolio is Microsoft Copilot , Microsoft 365 Copilot , Microsoft Security Copilot , and GitHub Copilot , among other generative AI solutions and experiences. Learn more 03/ How can AI help me improve productivity and efficiency in my daily tasks? AI can be a powerful ally in boosting productivity and efficiency. Here are some ways Microsoft AI can help streamline your daily tasks: Microsoft Copilot understands your questions and provides direct answers, assists with writing, and even creates images. For example, Copilot can help you give your resume a quick update, craft a post for social media, or write an email. Microsoft 365 Copilot integrates AI with Microsoft apps like Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and Outlook. It can assist with tasks like drafting emails, summarizing lengthy documents, creating reports from data, and managing your calendar. AI features in Microsoft Teams include real-time transcription, translation services, meeting summaries, and action items following the meeting. With Copilot Studio , you can easily design, test, and publish agents that suit your needs for internal or external scenarios across your industry, department, or role. You can build a standalone agent or publish to Microsoft 365 Copilot. For more customized productivity solutions, Azure offers a suite of tools to help you develop and deploy intelligent applications tailored to your needs. Get started 04/ How do I install and/or use Copilots? If you’re looking to use Copilot outside of work, you can start using Microsoft Copilot for free at copilot.microsoft.com or by downloading the Microsoft Copilot app on your mobile device. If you want to use Microsoft 365 Copilot at work , you’ll need to have an existing license for a qualifying Microsoft 365 plan and a license for Microsoft 365 Copilot.

Microsoft Copilot remembers details that matter to your daily life while keeping your personal data secure and protecting your privacy . You can always manage your privacy preferences in your Copilot Privacy settings. When you’re using Copilots at work, all your existing security and compliance requirements are inherited, so only people with the right permissions can access the content it generates. As a company, Microsoft is committed to providing trustworthy AI —with decades of research, customer feedback, and learnings informing the capabilities that deliver privacy, safety, and security Visit Microsoft’s Trust Center Learn about trustworthy AI 08/ What are the potential risks and challenges associated with implementing generative AI? Implementing generative AI comes with several considerations, including data security, biases, misinformation, and regulatory compliance. Ensuring the security of sensitive data and managing potential biases in AI-generated content are critical concerns—in addition to challenges related to transparency, accountability, and the potential misuse of AI technologies. Microsoft’s strategy paper, Minimize Risk and Reap the Benefits of AI , provides a comprehensive guide to navigating the challenges and opportunities of using generative AI. Explore responsible AI principles Visit Microsoft Trust Center 09/ How do I ensure the accuracy and reliability of AI-generated content? Ensuring the accuracy and reliability of AI-generated content requires evaluating and monitoring the performance of generative AI models. Microsoft's Microsoft Foundry offers evaluation metrics that assess the quality, safety, and relevance of generated content. Techniques such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) can also improve accuracy by using sourced data instead of relying solely on the model's training data.

Introduction to ML in BigQuery Note: This feature may not be available when using reservations that are created with
  certain BigQuery editions. For more information about which
  features are enabled in each edition, see Introduction to
  BigQuery editions . BigQuery ML lets you create and run machine learning (ML) models by
using either GoogleSQL queries or the Google Cloud console.
BigQuery ML models are stored
in BigQuery datasets, similar to tables and views.
BigQuery ML also lets you access Vertex AI models and Cloud AI APIs to perform artificial
intelligence (AI) tasks like text generation or machine
translation. Gemini for Google Cloud also provides AI-powered
assistance for BigQuery tasks. To see a list of AI-powered
features in BigQuery, see Gemini in BigQuery overview . Usually, performing ML or AI on large datasets requires extensive programming
and knowledge of ML frameworks. These requirements restrict solution development
to a very small set of people within each company, and they exclude data
analysts who understand the data but have limited ML knowledge and programming
expertise. However, with BigQuery ML, SQL practitioners can use
existing SQL tools and skills to build and evaluate models, and to generate
results from LLMs and Cloud AI APIs. You can work with BigQuery ML capabilities by using the
following: The Google Cloud console user interface, to work with models by using a UI .
( Preview ) The Google Cloud console query editor, to work with models by using SQL queries. The bq command-line tool The BigQuery REST API Integrated Colab Enterprise notebooks in BigQuery External tools such as a Jupyter notebook or business intelligence platform Advantages of BigQuery ML BigQuery ML offers several advantages over other approaches to
using ML or AI with a cloud-based data warehouse: BigQuery ML democratizes the use of ML and AI by empowering data
analysts, the primary data warehouse users, to build and run models using
existing business intelligence tools and spreadsheets. Predictive analytics
can guide business decision-making across the organization. You don't need to program an ML or AI solution using Python or Java. You
train models and access AI resources by using SQL—a language that's
familiar to data analysts. BigQuery ML increases the speed of model development and
innovation by removing the need to move data from the data warehouse.
Instead, BigQuery ML brings ML to the data, which offers the
following advantages: Reduced complexity because fewer tools are required. Increased speed to production because moving and formatting large amounts
of data for Python-based ML frameworks isn't required to train a model in
BigQuery. For more information, watch the video How to accelerate machine learning development with BigQuery ML . Recommended knowledge By using the default settings in the CREATE MODEL statements and the
inference functions, you can create and use BigQuery ML models
even without much ML knowledge. However, having basic knowledge about the
ML development lifecycle, such as feature engineering and model training,
helps you optimize both your data and your model to
deliver better results. We recommend using the following resources to develop
familiarity with ML techniques and processes: Machine Learning Crash Course Intro to Machine Learning Data Cleaning Feature Engineering Intermediate Machine Learning Work with time series You can use the TimesFM, ARIMA_PLUS , and ARIMA_PLUS_XREG models to perform forecasting and anomaly detection on time series data. Supported models A model in
BigQuery ML represents what an ML system has
learned from training data. The following sections describe the types of models
that BigQuery ML supports. For more information about
creating reservation assignments for the different types of models, see Assign slots to BigQuery ML workloads . Internally trained models The following models are built in to BigQuery ML: Contribution analysis is for determining the effect of
one or more dimensions on the value for a given metric. For example, seeing the
effect of store location and sales date on store revenue. For more
information, see Contribution analysis overview . Linear regression is for predicting the value of a numerical metric for new data by using a
model trained on similar remote data. Labels are real-valued, meaning
they cannot be positive infinity or negative infinity or a NaN (Not a Number). Logistic regression is for the classification of two or more possible values such as whether an
input is low-value , medium-value , or high-value . Labels can have up to 50 unique values. K-means clustering is for data segmentation. For example, this model identifies customer
segments. K-means is an unsupervised learning technique, so model training
doesn't require labels or split data for training or evaluation. Matrix factorization is for creating product recommendation systems. You can create product
recommendations using historical customer behavior, transactions, and product
ratings, and then use those recommendations for personalized customer
experiences. Principal component analysis (PCA) is the process of computing the principal components and using them to
perform a change of basis on the data. It's commonly used for dimensionality
reduction by projecting each data point onto only the first few principal
components to obtain lower-dimensional data while preserving as much of the
data's variation as possible. Time series is for performing time series forecasts and anomaly detection.
The ARIMA_PLUS and ARIMA_PLUS_XREG time series models offer multiple tuning options, and automatically handle
anomalies, seasonality, and holidays. If you don't want to manage your own time series forecasting model, you can
use the AI.FORECAST function with BigQuery ML's built-in TimesFM time series model ( Preview ) to perform forecasting. You can perform a dry run on the CREATE MODEL statements for internally trained models to get an estimate of
how much data they will process if you run them. Externally trained models The following models are external to BigQuery ML and trained in
Vertex AI: Deep neural network (DNN) is for creating TensorFlow-based deep neural networks for
classification and regression models. Wide & Deep is useful for generic large-scale regression and classification problems
with sparse inputs
( categorical features with a large number of possible feature values), such as recommender
systems, search, and ranking problems. Autoencoder is for creating TensorFlow-based models
with the support of sparse data representations. You can use the models in
BigQuery ML for tasks such as unsupervised anomaly detection
and non-linear dimensionality reduction. Boosted trees is for creating classification and regression models that are based on XGBoost . Random forest is for constructing multiple learning method decision trees for
classification, regression, and other tasks at training time. AutoML is a supervised ML service that builds and deploys classification and
regression models on tabular data at high speed and scale. You can't perform a dry run on the CREATE MODEL statements for externally trained models to get an estimate of
how much data they will process if you run them. Remote models You can create remote models in BigQuery that use models deployed to Vertex AI .
You reference the deployed model by specifying the model's HTTPS endpoint in the remote model's CREATE MODEL statement. The CREATE MODEL statements for remote models don't process any bytes and
don't incur BigQuery charges. Imported models BigQuery ML lets you import custom models that are trained outside
of BigQuery and then perform prediction within
BigQuery. You can import the following models into
BigQuery from Cloud Storage : Open Neural Network Exchange (ONNX) is an open standard format for representing ML models. Using
ONNX, you can make models that are trained with popular ML frameworks
like PyTorch and scikit-learn available in BigQuery ML. TensorFlow is a free, open source software library
for ML and artificial intelligence. You can use TensorFlow
across a range of tasks, but it has a particular focus on training and
inference of deep neural networks. You can load previously trained
TensorFlow models into BigQuery as
BigQuery ML models and then perform prediction in
BigQuery ML. TensorFlow Lite is a light version of TensorFlow for deployment on mobile
devices, microcontrollers, and other edge devices. TensorFlow
optimizes existing TensorFlow models for reduced model size and
faster inference. XGBoost is an optimized distributed gradient boosting library designed to be highly
efficient, flexible, and portable. It implements ML algorithms
under the gradient boosting framework. The CREATE MODEL statements for imported models don't process any bytes and
don't incur BigQuery charges. In BigQuery ML, you can use a model with data from multiple
BigQuery Datasets for training and for prediction. Model selection guide Download the model selection decision tree. BigQuery ML and Vertex AI BigQuery ML integrates with Vertex AI, which is the
end-to-end platform for AI and ML in Google Cloud. You can register your
BigQuery ML models to Model Registry in
order to deploy these models to endpoints for online prediction. For more
information, see the following: To learn more about using your BigQuery ML
models with Vertex AI, see Manage BigQuery ML models with Vertex AI . If you aren't familiar with Vertex AI and want to learn more
about how it integrates with BigQuery ML, see Vertex AI for BigQuery users . Watch the video How to simplify AI models with Vertex AI and BigQuery ML . BigQuery ML and Colab Enterprise You can now use Colab Enterprise notebooks to perform ML
workflows in BigQuery. Notebooks let you use SQL, Python,
and other popular libraries and languages to accomplish your ML tasks.
For more information, see Create notebooks . Supported regions BigQuery ML is supported in the same regions as
BigQuery. For more information, see BigQuery ML locations . Pricing You are charged for the compute resources that you use to train models and to
run queries against models. The type of model that you create affects where the
model is trained and the pricing that applies to that operation. Queries
against models always run in BigQuery and use BigQuery compute pricing .
Because remote models make calls to Vertex AI
models, queries against remote models also incur charges from
Vertex AI. You are charged for the storage used by trained models, using BigQuery storage pricing . For more information, see BigQuery ML pricing . Quotas In addition to BigQuery ML-specific limits ,
queries that use BigQuery ML functions and CREATE MODEL statements are subject to the quotas and limits on BigQuery query jobs . Limitations BigQuery ML isn't available in the Standard edition .

Reinforcement Learning (DQN) Tutorial # Created On: Mar 24, 2017 | Last Updated: Jun 16, 2025 | Last Verified: Nov 05, 2024 Author : Adam Paszke Mark Towers This tutorial shows how to use PyTorch to train a Deep Q Learning (DQN) agent
on the CartPole-v1 task from Gymnasium . You might find it helpful to read the original Deep Q Learning (DQN) paper Task The agent has to decide between two actions - moving the cart left or
right - so that the pole attached to it stays upright. You can find more
information about the environment and other more challenging environments at Gymnasium’s website . CartPole # As the agent observes the current state of the environment and chooses
an action, the environment transitions to a new state, and also
returns a reward that indicates the consequences of the action. In this
task, rewards are +1 for every incremental timestep and the environment
terminates if the pole falls over too far or the cart moves more than 2.4
units away from center. This means better performing scenarios will run
for longer duration, accumulating larger return. The CartPole task is designed so that the inputs to the agent are 4 real
values representing the environment state (position, velocity, etc.).
We take these 4 inputs without any scaling and pass them through a
small fully-connected network with 2 outputs, one for each action.
The network is trained to predict the expected value for each action,
given the input state. The action with the highest expected value is
then chosen. Packages First, let’s import needed packages. Firstly, we need gymnasium for the environment,
installed by using pip . This is a fork of the original OpenAI
Gym project and maintained by the same team since Gym v0.19.
If you are running this in Google Colab, run: %%bash
pip3 install gymnasium [ classic_control ] We’ll also use the following from PyTorch: neural networks ( torch.nn ) optimization ( torch.optim ) automatic differentiation ( torch.autograd ) import gymnasium as gym import math import random import matplotlib import matplotlib.pyplot as plt from collections import namedtuple , deque from itertools import count import torch import torch.nn as nn import torch.optim as optim import torch.nn.functional as F env = gym . make ( ""CartPole-v1"" ) # set up matplotlib is_ipython = 'inline' in matplotlib . get_backend () if is_ipython : from IPython import display plt . ion () # if GPU is to be used device = torch . device ( ""cuda"" if torch . cuda . is_available () else ""mps"" if torch . backends . mps . is_available () else ""cpu"" ) # To ensure reproducibility during training, you can fix the random seeds # by uncommenting the lines below. This makes the results consistent across # runs, which is helpful for debugging or comparing different approaches. # # That said, allowing randomness can be beneficial in practice, as it lets # the model explore different training trajectories. # seed = 42 # random.seed(seed) # torch.manual_seed(seed) # env.reset(seed=seed) # env.action_space.seed(seed) # env.observation_space.seed(seed) # if torch.cuda.is_available(): #     torch.cuda.manual_seed(seed) Gym has been unmaintained since 2022 and does not support NumPy 2.0 amongst other critical functionality.
Please upgrade to Gymnasium, the maintained drop-in replacement of Gym, or contact the authors of your software and request that they upgrade.
Users of this version of Gym should be able to simply replace 'import gym' with 'import gymnasium as gym' in the vast majority of cases.
See the migration guide at https://gymnasium.farama.org/introduction/migration_guide/ for additional information. Replay Memory # We’ll be using experience replay memory for training our DQN. It stores
the transitions that the agent observes, allowing us to reuse this data
later. By sampling from it randomly, the transitions that build up a
batch are decorrelated. It has been shown that this greatly stabilizes
and improves the DQN training procedure. For this, we’re going to need two classes: Transition - a named tuple representing a single transition in
our environment. It essentially maps (state, action) pairs
to their (next_state, reward) result, with the state being the
screen difference image as described later on. ReplayMemory - a cyclic buffer of bounded size that holds the
transitions observed recently. It also implements a .sample() method for selecting a random batch of transitions for training. Transition = namedtuple ( 'Transition' , ( 'state' , 'action' , 'next_state' , 'reward' )) class ReplayMemory ( object ): def __init__ ( self , capacity ): self . memory = deque ([], maxlen = capacity ) def push ( self , * args ): """"""Save a transition"""""" self . memory . append ( Transition ( * args )) def sample ( self , batch_size ): return random . sample ( self . memory , batch_size ) def __len__ ( self ): return len ( self . memory ) Now, let’s define our model. But first, let’s quickly recap what a DQN is. DQN algorithm # Our environment is deterministic, so all equations presented here are
also formulated deterministically for the sake of simplicity. In the
reinforcement learning literature, they would also contain expectations
over stochastic transitions in the environment. Our aim will be to train a policy that tries to maximize the discounted,
cumulative reward \(R_{t_0} = \sum_{t=t_0}^{\infty} \gamma^{t - t_0} r_t\) , where \(R_{t_0}\) is also known as the return . The discount, \(\gamma\) , should be a constant between \(0\) and \(1\) that ensures the sum converges. A lower \(\gamma\) makes
rewards from the uncertain far future less important for our agent
than the ones in the near future that it can be fairly confident
about. It also encourages agents to collect reward closer in time
than equivalent rewards that are temporally far away in the future. The main idea behind Q-learning is that if we had a function \(Q^*: State \times Action \rightarrow \mathbb{R}\) , that could tell
us what our return would be, if we were to take an action in a given
state, then we could easily construct a policy that maximizes our
rewards: \[\pi^*(s) = \arg\!\max_a \ Q^*(s, a)

\] However, we don’t know everything about the world, so we don’t have
access to \(Q^*\) . But, since neural networks are universal function
approximators, we can simply create one and train it to resemble \(Q^*\) . For our training update rule, we’ll use a fact that every \(Q\) function for some policy obeys the Bellman equation: \[Q^{\pi}(s, a) = r + \gamma Q^{\pi}(s', \pi(s'))

\] The difference between the two sides of the equality is known as the
temporal difference error, \(\delta\) : \[\delta = Q(s, a) - (r + \gamma \max_a' Q(s', a))

\] To minimize this error, we will use the Huber
loss . The Huber loss acts
like the mean squared error when the error is small, but like the mean
absolute error when the error is large - this makes it more robust to
outliers when the estimates of \(Q\) are very noisy. We calculate
this over a batch of transitions, \(B\) , sampled from the replay
memory: \[\mathcal{L} = \frac{1}{|B|}\sum_{(s, a, s', r) \ \in \ B} \mathcal{L}(\delta)\] \[\text{where} \quad \mathcal{L}(\delta) = \begin{cases}
  \frac{1}{2}{\delta^2}  & \text{for } |\delta| \le 1, \\
  |\delta| - \frac{1}{2} & \text{otherwise.}
\end{cases}\] Q-network # Our model will be a feed forward  neural network that takes in the
difference between the current and previous screen patches. It has two
outputs, representing \(Q(s, \mathrm{left})\) and \(Q(s, \mathrm{right})\) (where \(s\) is the input to the
network). In effect, the network is trying to predict the expected return of
taking each action given the current input. class DQN ( nn . Module ): def __init__ ( self , n_observations , n_actions ): super ( DQN , self ) . __init__ () self . layer1 = nn .

Here, you can find an optimize_model function that performs a
single step of the optimization. It first samples a batch, concatenates
all the tensors into a single one, computes \(Q(s_t, a_t)\) and \(V(s_{t+1}) = \max_a Q(s_{t+1}, a)\) , and combines them into our
loss. By definition we set \(V(s) = 0\) if \(s\) is a terminal
state. We also use a target network to compute \(V(s_{t+1})\) for
added stability. The target network is updated at every step with a soft update controlled by
the hyperparameter TAU , which was previously defined. def optimize_model (): if len ( memory ) < BATCH_SIZE : return transitions = memory . sample ( BATCH_SIZE ) # Transpose the batch (see https://stackoverflow.com/a/19343/3343043 for # detailed explanation).

At the beginning we reset
the environment and obtain the initial state Tensor. Then, we sample
an action, execute it, observe the next state and the reward (always
1), and optimize our model once. When the episode ends (our model
fails), we restart the loop. Below, num_episodes is set to 600 if a GPU is available, otherwise 50
episodes are scheduled so training does not take too long. However, 50
episodes is insufficient for to observe good performance on CartPole.
You should see the model constantly achieve 500 steps within 600 training
episodes. Training RL agents can be a noisy process, so restarting training
can produce better results if convergence is not observed. if torch . cuda . is_available () or torch . backends . mps . is_available (): num_episodes = 600 else : num_episodes = 50 for i_episode in range ( num_episodes ): # Initialize the environment and get its state state , info = env . reset () state = torch . tensor ( state , dtype = torch . float32 , device = device ) . unsqueeze ( 0 ) for t in count (): action = select_action ( state ) observation , reward , terminated , truncated , _ = env . step ( action . item ()) reward = torch . tensor ([ reward ], device = device ) done = terminated or truncated if terminated : next_state = None else : next_state = torch . tensor ( observation , dtype = torch . float32 , device = device ) . unsqueeze ( 0 ) # Store the transition in memory memory . push ( state , action , next_state , reward ) # Move to the next state state = next_state # Perform one step of the optimization (on the policy network) optimize_model () # Soft update of the target network's weights # θ′ ← τ θ + (1 −τ )θ′ target_net_state_dict = target_net . state_dict () policy_net_state_dict = policy_net . state_dict () for key in policy_net_state_dict : target_net_state_dict [ key ] = policy_net_state_dict [ key ] * TAU + target_net_state_dict [ key ] * ( 1 - TAU ) target_net . load_state_dict ( target_net_state_dict ) if done : episode_durations . append ( t + 1 ) plot_durations () break print ( 'Complete' ) plot_durations ( show_result = True ) plt . ioff () plt . show () /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages/gymnasium/utils/passive_env_checker.py:249: DeprecationWarning:

Optimization picks a random batch from the replay memory to do training of the
new policy. The “older” target_net is also used in optimization to compute the
expected Q values. A soft update of its weights are performed at every step.

"CS234: Reinforcement Learning Winter 2025 CS234: Reinforcement Learning Winter 2025 Course Schedule Lecture Materials Assignments Course Project Calendar Ed Forum SCPD FAQ Course Description & Logistics To realize the dreams and impact of AI requires autonomous systems that learn to make good decisions.
				Reinforcement learning is one powerful paradigm for doing so, and it is relevant to an enormous range
				of tasks, including robotics, game playing, consumer modeling and healthcare. This class will provide
				a solid introduction to the field of reinforcement learning and students will learn about the core
				challenges and approaches, including generalization and exploration. Through a combination of lectures,
				and written and coding assignments, students will become well versed in key ideas and techniques for RL.
				Assignments will include the basics of reinforcement learning as well as deep reinforcement learning —
				an extremely promising new area that combines deep learning techniques with reinforcement learning. Communication: We will use Ed discussion forums. We encourage all students to use Ed for the fastest response to your questions. Lectures will be live every Tuesday and Thursday: Videos of the lecture content will also be made available to enrolled students through canvas. Office hours: Will be announced in the first week of class Platforms: All assignments and quizzes will be handled through Gradescope, where you will also find your
				grades. We will send out links and access codes to enrolled students through Canvas. You can find Spring 2024 materials here. Course Instructor Emma Brunskill Course Assistants Chethan Bhateja (Head TA) Aishwarya Mandyam HyunJi (Alex) Nam Hengyuan Hu Lansong (Ryan) Li Shiyu Zhao Keenon Werling Prerequisites for This Class Proficiency in Python All class assignments will be in Python.
						There is a tutorial here for
						those who aren't as familiar with Python. If you have a lot of programming experience but
						in a different language (e.g. C/ C++/ Matlab/ Javascript) you will probably be fine. College Calculus, Linear Algebra (e.g. MATH 51, CME 100) You should be comfortable taking derivatives and understanding matrix vector operations and
						notation. Basic Probability and Statistics (e.g. CS 109 or other stats course) You should know basics of probabilities, Gaussian distributions, mean, standard deviation, etc. Foundations of Machine Learning We will be formulating cost functions, taking derivatives and performing optimization with
						gradient descent. Either CS 221 or CS 229 cover this background. Some optimization tricks will be
						more intuitive with some knowledge of convex optimization. Learning Outcomes By the end of the class students should be able to: Define the key features of reinforcement learning that distinguishes it from AI
						and non-interactive machine learning (as assessed by the exam). Given an application problem (e.g. from computer vision, robotics, etc), decide
						if it should be formulated as a RL problem; if yes be able to define it formally
						(in terms of the state space, action space, dynamics and reward model), state what
						algorithm (from class) is best suited for addressing it and justify your answer
						(as assessed by the exam). Implement in code common RL algorithms (as assessed by the assignments). Describe (list and define) multiple criteria for analyzing RL algorithms and evaluate
						algorithms on these metrics: e.g. regret, sample complexity, computational complexity,
						empirical performance, convergence, etc (as assessed by assignments and the exam). Describe the exploration vs exploitation challenge and compare and contrast at least
						two approaches for addressing this challenge (in terms of performance, scalability,
						complexity of implementation, and theoretical guarantees) (as assessed by an assignment
						and the exam). Course Lecture Materials  (Videos and Slides) See the Lecture Materials page.

You may participate in these remotely as well. These are due by Sunday at 6pm for the week of lecture. You should complete these by logging in with your Stanford sunid in order for your participation to count.] Late Day Policy You can use 5 late days total. A late day extends the deadline by 24 hours. You are allowed up to 2 late days for assignments 1, 2, 3, project proposal, and project milestone,  not to exceed 5 late days total. You may not use any late days for the project poster presentation and final project paper. For group submissions such as the project proposal and milestone, all group members must have the corresponding number of late days used on the assignment, and if one or more members do not have a sufficient amount of late days, all group members will incur a grade penalty of 50% within 24 hours and 100% after 24 hours, as explained below. If you use two late days and hand an assignment in after 48 hours, it will be worth at most 50%. If you do not have enough late days left, handing the assignment within 1 day after it was due (adjusting for the late days used) will be worth at most 50%. No credit will be given to assignments handed in after 24 hours they were due (adjusting for any late days. E.g. if you use 2 late days, then after this policy applies 24 hours after your 2 late days, e.g. after 72 hours). Please contact us if you think you have an extremely rare circumstance for which we should make an exception. This policy is to ensure that feedback can be given in a timely manner. Exams There will be one midterm and one quiz. See the schedule for the dates. Exams will be held in class for on-campus students. Conflicts : If you are not able to attend the in class 
	midterm and quizzes with an official reason, please email us at cs234-win2425-staff@lists.stanford.edu , as soon as you can 
	so that an accommodation can be scheduled. (Historically this is either to ask you 
	to take the exam remotely at the same time, or to schedule an alternate exam time). Notes for the exams : You are welcome to bring a 1-sided 1 
	(letter sized) page of handwritten notes to the midterm. For the quiz you 
	are welcome to bring a double sided (letter sized) page of handwritten notes. No calculators, laptops, cell phones, tablets or other resources will 
	be allowed. Assignments and Submission Process Assignments : See Assignments page where all the assignments will be posted. Computing Resources : We will have some cloud resources available for later assignments. Submission Process : The submission instructions for the assignments
					can also be found on the Assignments page . Communication We believe students often learn an enormous amount from each other as well as from us, the course staff.
				Therefore
				to facilitate
				discussion and peer learning, we request that you please use Ed for all questions related to lectures and
				assignments. For SCPD students, if you have generic SCPD specific questions, please email scpdsupport@stanford.edu or call 650-741-1542. In case you have specific questions related to being a SCPD student for this particular
				class, please contact
				us at cs234-win2425-staff@lists.stanford.edu . For exceptional circumstances that require us to make special arrangements, please email us at cs234-win2425-staff@lists.stanford.edu . For example,
				such a situation may arise if a
				student requires extra days
				to submit a homework due to a medical emergency, or if a student needs to schedule an alternative midterm date
				due
				to events such as
				conference travel etc. They will be considered and approved on a case by case basis. Regrading Requests If you think that the course staff made a quantifiable error in grading your assignment
                or exam, then you are welcome to submit a regrade request. Regrade requests should be made on gradescope and will be accepted
            for three days after assignments or exams are returned. Note that while doing a regrade  we may review your entire assigment, not just the part you
                bring to our attention (i.e. we may find errors in your work that we missed before). Academic Collaboration, AI Tools Usage and Misconduct I care about academic collaboration and misconduct because it is important both that we are able to evaluate
					your own work (independent of your peer’s)
					and because not claiming others’ work as your own is an important part of integrity in your future career. I
					understand that different
					institutions and locations can have different definitions of what forms of collaborative behavior is
					considered
					acceptable. In this class,
					for written homework problems, you are welcome to discuss ideas with others, but you are expected to write up
					your own solutions
					independently (without referring to another’s solutions). For coding, you may only share the input-output behavior
					of your programs. This encourages you to work separately but share ideas
					on how to test your implementation. 
				

Please remember that if you share your solution with another student, even
					if you did not copy from
					another, you are still violating the honor code.

Consistent with this, it is also considered an honor code violation if you make your assignment solutions publicly available, such as posting them online or in a 
public git repo. We may run similarity-detection software over all submitted student programs, including programs from
					past quarters and any
					solutions found online on public websites. Anyone violating the Stanford University Honor Code will be referred to the
					Office of Judicial Affairs.
					If you think you made a mistake (it can happen, especially under stress or when time is short!), please reach
					out to Emma or the head CA;
					the consequences will be much less severe than if we approach you.

					We expect all students to submit their own solutions to CS234 homeworks, exams and quizzes, and 
					for projects. You are permitted to use generative AI tools such as Gemini, GPT-4 and Co-Pilot 
					in the same way that human collaboration is considered acceptable: you are not allowed to directly 
					ask for solutions or copy code, and you should indicate if you have used generative AI tools. 
					Similar to human collaboration help, you are ultimately responsible and accountable for your own work.
					We may check students' homework, exams and projects to 
				enforce this policy. Note that it is not acceptable to list a LLM as a collaborator on the project 
					milestone or final report: as things stand, generative AI cannot accept 
					fault or responsibility, and thus cannot be a collaborator in a final project. Academic Accommodation If you need an academic accommodation based on the impact of a disability, please share your  Office of Accessible Education letter with us via an email to our course staff list as soon as it is convenient for you. This helps us ensure 
the course materials and staff support can comply with your needs.

E Edgar Maucourant Jun 18, 2025 Great course to understand modern algorithms in RL. Great course to understand modern algorithms in RL. A Andrei Sep 9, 2024 Considering that to buy this course you need to pay Udacity subscription at least one month (250$), this course is simply a scam: 

Pytorch codes from 6 years ago! That is, the course is still exactly the same from the day it was released, and today (as of 2024) it is outdated. What's more, in some videos they name certain Git hub repositories that have changed. This appears in the actor-critic methods section, which is literally a man marketing himself and reading the code without explaining it, as if he were reading poems.
Generally poor explanations of videos of less than 5 minutes, unless you consult the papers and the book that offers, if you start watching the videos you learn rather little. Very poor explanations of programming codes. 
Unpractical exercises. You have to solve DL problems from already built environments, that is, the practical part is limited to solve video game type environments that have no real life utility. Anywhere is there an example of how to build your own environment? → NO, 
Impossible deliverables. If you give me a few GPU hours and I have to build my own models and test infinite hyperparameters how am I going to perform that task, if all I can do is copy a code from the internet that I know works so I don't spend those hours? They give very few GPU hours to solve the problems, and these have a lot to do with launching a model, waiting, changing hyperparameters etc.

The only good thing about the course is the papers and github repos it redirects to, which are useful. I mean, you pay an absurd amount of money for some internet links.

Data science remains one of the most in-demand technical skills for career advancers. In an edX survey of 1,000 workers, data analysis and visualization ranked among the top three skills for career advancement, alongside AI and machine learning. A data science course or program can expand your analytical skills and sharpen your knowledge of statistics and mathematics. This can prepare you to address real-world problems across multiple sectors, an invaluable skill in the era of big data when data sets are often too large and complex to fit into the memory of a single computer. How to start learning data science? If you're curious about the field or planning a full career shift, here are three steps to guide you on how to get started in data science: 1. Understand what data science is Get familiar with what data scientists actually do before committing time or money. Understand the kinds of problems they solve, the tools they use, the required knowledge (including advanced math), and the various industries they can work in. This may help you clarify whether data science fits your interests, goals, and abilities. You can start with edX's data science career hub , which breaks down salary and industry insights, required skills, and potential career paths. 2. Build data science skills with online courses and programs If you're testing the waters, short online data science courses are a great starting point for developing data science skills. Foundational courses typically cover statistics, data analysis, artificial intelligence, and machine learning fundamentals, Python, R, and SQL programming basics. If you prefer a more structured educational approach to learning, an online bachelor's degree program in data science may be an option. Career switchers or those looking to advance may find alternative credentials — such as a professional certificate or a MicroMasters® — beneficial for learning data science. If you're already a data scientist and want to advance to leadership roles, consider enrolling in an executive education program . 3. Practice your data science skills regularly To become a data scientist, practice is essential for developing in-demand, job-ready skills. Focus on building hands-on experience in: Programming languages like Python, R, and SQL Data visualization tools like Tableau or Power BI Machine learning basics Statistical analysis Data wrangling (cleaning and preparing data) Building side projects using public datasets, joining online data science communities, and participating in coding challenges may be ways to develop these skills outside the classroom. Seek opportunities like internships, freelance projects, or capstone experiences within your chosen program to create a strong portfolio. What to expect from online data science programs? A typical data science curriculum includes courses in math, statistics, computer modeling, programming, and big data and data science. These programs will introduce you to a variety of new skills and concepts, including: R programming Statistical analysis Regression analysis Data structures Neural networks Structured Query Language (SQL) TensorFlow or other machine learning platforms Basic data analysis with Excel Data visualization with Tableau or Power BI. You can also study data engineering concepts or focus on the visualization components of data science via self-paced options. The outcome remains the same regardless of the course of study you choose — you will learn to leverage technology to interpret and predict complex data. How long does it take to learn data science? It typically takes 4-7 years to learn data science. Most data science jobs require a bachelor's degree, which will take four years to earn if you study on a full-time schedule. A master's degree in data science typically takes 2-3 years to complete. Careers in data science: Jobs, salary, and qualifications Data science jobs exist in many industries, including healthcare, marketing, retail, finance, education, and government. These professionals typically work in an office setting or remotely, either for a company that will use the data or for a third-party organization that is preparing data insights for a client.

Frequently asked questions What is data science? Data science is the process of analyzing large pools of data to find trends and draw conclusions that can drive decision-making. It is a multidisciplinary field that combines mathematics and statistics, specialized programming, advanced analytics, artificial intelligence (AI), and machine learning to transform raw numbers into actionable insights. This empowers business decision-making, strategy, and scientific discovery. Which course is best for data science? There isn't a single best course for data science. To work as a data scientist, you'll need to master rigorous subjects like statistics, computer programming, artificial intelligence, and machine learning, as well as develop good communication skills. Depending on your goals and experience, you may start with a beginner course or pursue a bachelor's degree, MicroMasters, master's degree, professional certificate, or executive education program. Is three months enough for data science? For most individuals, three months may not be enough to learn data science. If you already have a strong background in computer science, software engineering, or a related field, you can take a short course or certificate program to hone your skills. However, if you're new to the subject or want to pursue a degree, it can take four years or more to finish your education. Is data science hard to learn? With the right resources, courses, and instructors, you can learn the ins and outs of data science with ease and at your own pace. While learners with prior knowledge of coding and mathematics may be at an advantage, someone with no prior experience can get up to speed in an introductory course or program. What skills are required to be a data scientist? Data scientists have a deep technical understanding of computer programming, data mining, AI, and predictive analytics, which helps them organize and analyze information. While technical ability is important to this profession, data scientists should also consider honing strong soft skills like effective communication. Does data science require coding? While many data science job titles require some level of coding experience, learners do not need to be expert coders to advance in this field. That said, it's a good idea to familiarize yourself with coding basics prior to or while you learn data science so you know what to expect on the job. Are data analytics and data science the same thing? Not exactly. While there is overlap between the two, data analytics is a branch of data science that focuses on examining data sets to find trends and draw conclusions. Data science takes it a step further, using programming, math, and statistics to identify recurring trends, spot problems, and create organizational solutions. In fact, many data scientists begin their careers as data analysts.

Rather, the neural networks predict noise or a noised quantity. In this paper, we suggest that predicting clean data and predicting noised quantities are fundamentally different. According to the manifold assumption, natural data should lie on a low-dimensional manifold, whereas noised quantities do not. With this assumption, we advocate for models that directly predict clean data, which allows apparently under-capacity networks to operate effectively in very high-dimensional spaces. We show that simple, large-patch Transformers on pixels can be strong generative models: using no tokenizer, no pre-training, and no extra loss. Our approach is conceptually nothing more than ""Just image Transformers"", or JiT, as we call it. We report competitive results using JiT with large patch sizes of 16 and 32 on ImageNet at resolutions of 256 and 512, where predicting high-dimensional noised quantities can fail catastrophically. With our networks mapping back to the basics of the manifold, our research goes back to basics and pursues a self-contained paradigm for Transformer-based diffusion on raw natural data.

Rather, the neural networks predict noise or a noised quantity. In this paper, we suggest that predicting clean data and predicting noised quantities are fundamentally different. According to the manifold assumption, natural data should lie on a low-dimensional manifold, whereas noised quantities do not. With this assumption, we advocate for models that directly predict clean data, which allows apparently under-capacity networks to operate effectively in very high-dimensional spaces. We show that simple, large-patch Transformers on pixels can be strong generative models: using no tokenizer, no pre-training, and no extra loss. Our approach is conceptually nothing more than ""Just image Transformers"", or JiT, as we call it. We report competitive results using JiT with large patch sizes of 16 and 32 on ImageNet at resolutions of 256 and 512, where predicting high-dimensional noised quantities can fail catastrophically. With our networks mapping back to the basics of the manifold, our research goes back to basics and pursues a self-contained paradigm for Transformer-based diffusion on raw natural data.

A lite version of this platform is also available at arxiv-sanity-lite.com . You can create an account, browse or search for specific topics, and explore similar papers to get started. When you find documents of interest and save them to your library, Arxiv Sanity provides personalized recommendations and updates. Here’s a video by Karpathy on how to use it: SSRN(Social Science Research Network) is another preprint server that focuses more on social science domains, including humanities, life sciences, and health sciences. This site can be handy if you are looking for cross-domain research papers. Source #2 Search Engines for Research Papers Many journals and conferences publish enormous amounts of research papers, and various search engines and platforms aggregate research papers and make it easier for you to discover relevant work in AI. Google Scholar is the most widely used and accessible search engine for academic papers in all domains. You can also use power search techniques such as Boolean operators and keyword optimization to find specific documents. For example, Copy Search Query deep learning AND neural networks author: ""Yann LeCun"" Furthermore, you can create email alerts in Google search, such that Google Scholar will send you a regular update of new research by an author on a particular topic you selected. Alternatively, platforms, such as Semantic Scholar , use semantic search to find relevant publications based on the topics. Furthermore, it can provide super-short summaries of the objectives and results of the paper with its TLDR features and recommend articles based on your document browsing history. Another platform, Consensus , more focused on general domains, has broad search capabilities and a Consensus Meter that aggregates findings from multiple papers to show the overall Consensus on a particular topic, helping you gauge the general agreement in the research community. It also has an integrated copilot feature that offers AI-powered assistance for drafting content, creating lists, and answering questions based on research papers. Source #3 Using AI to find Papers on AI Why not ask an AI to give you papers on AI? This way, you could quickly narrow down your research with appropriate context in your prompt.

You might have to sign in / sign up for the platform and allow ChatGPT to talk with the plugin. Copy Prompt Find me papers on improving reasoning ability of Large Language models by embedding logical reasoning systems You can customize it with better prompting techniques; however, the plugin is optimized to give you titles, summaries, and DOI links to the article and a downloadable PDF link (if available). If your preferred LLM has access to the web, you can use it too, but the results might not be as good as using a database-linked LLM. In this regard, perplexity.ai can help you combine multiple papers toward your research goal, allowing you to narrow down your research through academic papers. Source #4 Top Journals Academic journals provide peer-reviewed research to ensure a high standard of quality. Many such journals, such as IEEE Xplore, ACM (Association for Computing Machinery) Digital Library, may require subscriptions. Many of these journals are well-regarded and ranked with different methodologies. Here are some of the top journals: Neural Networks covers research on neural networks and related learning systems and has been in publication since 1988. Foundations and Trends in Machine Learning have the highest impact factor (IF), covering a wide range of topics in ML. International Journal of Computer Vision has the highest IF in the field of computer vision. Artificial Intelligence publishes papers on broad aspects of AI. IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence publishes research in artificial intelligence, particularly in AI, machine learning, and computer vision. Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research is an open-access journal publishing high-quality research across all domains of artificial intelligence. These are just a few of thousands of journals. The question is, how can you find top journals in your domain of interest? You can use a journal finder such as Elsevier Journal Finder or search on reputable journal databases.

Resources & tools RESEARCH AREAS 01. Communication & Language We advance AI capabilities in expressive communication, social interaction and use of language. Through foundational research in natural language processing and multimodal AI, we develop systems that enable more natural, meaningful interactions between humans and machines. 02. Embodiment & Actions We advance the fundamental capabilities needed for AI to understand and act within the physical and digital world. Through our research, we hope to unlock a wide variety of future agents that help humans do more throughout all aspects of their lives. From robots that can move around, interact with objects, to help accomplish household tasks, to wearable glasses that understand the real and digital world and support people throughout their daily tasks. 03. Alignment Our research focuses on aligning models and decisions with human intent and societal interests through deeper fundamental understanding and enhanced steerability and efficiency of AI models. The pillar is at the forefront of research on AI for science and AI for society. 04. Core Learning & Reasoning We conduct fundamental research in pre-training methods and new architectural paradigms that enable foundation models to learn and reason with agility and efficiency across novel downstream challenges. Our work expands the frontier of approaches such as world models, non-autoregressive architectures, and memory-augmented models to unlock new capabilities in adaptive intelligence. 05. Coding We develop code world models as foundational models for code and agents, and advance methods to do reinforcement learning with execution feedback. We research how to do much more efficient architectures for code world models, latent space reasoning, and grounded reasoning and planning with world models. We develop various agents, e.g. AI research agents to help our own research, and upstream our agents’ needs to our foundational models. 06. Perception The north star goal of our Perception research teams is to enable general AI systems to perceive the visual world to inform action, communication, and generation. To achieve this goal, we're developing next generation perception models capable of understanding images and videos not as pixels, but as a capture of visual entities like people, objects, activities, their spatial and temporal relationships. Our latest models bring mixture-of-experts architecture, native multimodal capabilities, near limitless context windows, and billion-scale performance.

There are three sets of video tutorials in the series: The eponymous Deep Learning with TensorFlow, Keras, and PyTorch (released in Feb 2020) Deep Learning for Natural Language Processing, 2nd Ed. (Feb 2020) Machine Vision, GANs, and Deep Reinforcement Learning (Mar 2020) The above order is the recommended sequence in which to undertake these tutorials. That said, the first in the series provides a strong foundation for either of the other two. Taken all together, the series -- over 18 total hours of instruction and hands-on demos -- parallels the entirety of the content in the book Deep Learning Illustrated . This means that the videos introduce all of deep learning : What deep neural networks are and how they work, both mathematically and using the most popular code libraries Machine vision , primarily with convolutional neural networks Natural language processing , including with recurrent neural networks Artistic creativity with generative adversarial networks (GANs) Complex, sequential decision-making with deep reinforcement learning These video tutorials also includes some extra content that is not available in the book, such as: Detailed interactive examples involving training and testing deep learning models in PyTorch How to generate novel sequences of natural language in the style of your training data High-level discussion of transformer-based natural-language-processing models like BERT, ELMo, and GPT-3 Detailed interactive examples of training advanced machine vision models (image segmentation, object detection) All hands-on code demos involving TensorFlow or Keras have been updated to TensorFlow 2 Installation Installation instructions for running the code in this repository can be found in the installation directory . Notebooks There are dozens of meticulously crafted Jupyter notebooks of code associated with these videos. All of them can be found in this directory .

python. It contains the example code and solutions to the exercises in the third edition of my O'Reilly book Hands-on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras and TensorFlow (3rd edition) : Note : If you are looking for the second edition notebooks, check out ageron/handson-ml2 . For the first edition, see ageron/handson-ml . Quick Start Want to play with these notebooks online without having to install anything? (recommended) ⚠ Colab provides a temporary environment: anything you do will be deleted after a while, so make sure you download any data you care about. Other services may work as well, but I have not fully tested them: Just want to quickly look at some notebooks, without executing any code? github.com's notebook viewer also works but it's not ideal: it's slower, the math equations are not always displayed correctly, and large notebooks often fail to open. Want to run this project using a Docker image? Read the Docker instructions . Want to install this project on your own machine? Start by installing Anaconda (or Miniconda ), git , and if you have a TensorFlow-compatible GPU, install the GPU driver , as well as the appropriate version of CUDA and cuDNN (see TensorFlow's documentation for more details). Next, clone this project by opening a terminal and typing the following commands (do not type the first $ signs on each line, they just indicate that these are terminal commands): $ git clone https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml3.git
$ cd handson-ml3 Next, run the following commands: $ conda env create -f environment.yml
$ conda activate homl3
$ python -m ipykernel install --user --name=python3 Finally, start Jupyter: $ jupyter notebook If you need further instructions, read the detailed installation instructions . FAQ Which Python version should I use? I recommend Python 3.10. If you follow the installation instructions above, that's the version you will get. Any version ≥3.7 should work as well. I'm getting an error when I call load_housing_data() If you're getting an HTTP error, make sure you're running the exact same code as in the notebook (copy/paste it if needed). If the problem persists, please check your network configuration. If it's an SSL error, see the next question. I'm getting an SSL error on MacOSX You probably need to install the SSL certificates (see this StackOverflow question ). If you downloaded Python from the official website, then run /Applications/Python\ 3.10/Install\ Certificates.command in a terminal (change 3.10 to whatever version you installed). If you installed Python using MacPorts, run sudo port install curl-ca-bundle in a terminal. I've installed this project locally. How do I update it to the latest version? See INSTALL.md How do I update my Python libraries to the latest versions, when using Anaconda? See INSTALL.md Contributors I would like to thank everyone who contributed to this project , either by providing useful feedback, filing issues or submitting Pull Requests. Special thanks go to Haesun Park and Ian Beauregard who reviewed every notebook and submitted many PRs, including help on some of the exercise solutions. Thanks as well to Steven Bunkley and Ziembla who created the docker directory, and to github user SuperYorio who helped on some exercise solutions. Thanks a lot to Victor Khaustov who submitted plenty of excellent PRs, fixing many errors. And lastly, thanks to Google ML Developer Programs team who supported this work by providing Google Cloud Credit.

All code is written in Python, and the book itself is written using Jupyter Notebook so that you can run and modify the code in your browser. What better way to learn? ""Kalman and Bayesian Filters in Python"" looks amazing! ... your book is just what I needed - Allen Downey, Professor and O'Reilly author. Thanks for all your work on publishing your introductory text on Kalman Filtering, as well as the Python Kalman Filtering libraries. We’ve been using it internally to teach some key state estimation concepts to folks and it’s been a huge help. - Sam Rodkey, SpaceX Start reading online now by clicking the binder or Azure badge below: What are Kalman and Bayesian Filters? Sensors are noisy. The world is full of data and events that we want to measure and track, but we cannot rely on sensors to give us perfect information. The GPS in my car reports altitude. Each time I pass the same point in the road it reports a slightly different altitude. My kitchen scale gives me different readings if I weigh the same object twice. In simple cases the solution is obvious. If my scale gives slightly different readings I can just take a few readings and average them. Or I can replace it with a more accurate scale. But what do we do when the sensor is very noisy, or the environment makes data collection difficult? We may be trying to track the movement of a low flying aircraft. We may want to create an autopilot for a drone, or ensure that our farm tractor seeded the entire field. I work on computer vision, and I need to track moving objects in images, and the computer vision algorithms create very noisy and unreliable results. This book teaches you how to solve these sorts of filtering problems. I use many different algorithms, but they are all based on Bayesian probability. In simple terms Bayesian probability determines what is likely to be true based on past information. If I asked you the heading of my car at this moment you would have no idea. You'd prefer a number between 1° and 360° degrees, and have a 1 in 360 chance of being right. Now suppose I told you that 2 seconds ago its heading was 243°. In 2 seconds my car could not turn very far, so you could make a far more accurate prediction. You are using past information to more accurately infer information about the present or future. The world is also noisy. That prediction helps you make a better estimate, but it also subject to noise. I may have just braked for a dog or swerved around a pothole. Strong winds and ice on the road are external influences on the path of my car. In control literature we call this noise though you may not think of it that way. There is more to Bayesian probability, but you have the main idea. Knowledge is uncertain, and we alter our beliefs based on the strength of the evidence. Kalman and Bayesian filters blend our noisy and limited knowledge of how a system behaves with the noisy and limited sensor readings to produce the best possible estimate of the state of the system. Our principle is to never discard information. Say we are tracking an object and a sensor reports that it suddenly changed direction. Did it really turn, or is the data noisy? It depends. If this is a jet fighter we'd be very inclined to believe the report of a sudden maneuver. If it is a freight train on a straight track we would discount it. We'd further modify our belief depending on how accurate the sensor is. Our beliefs depend on the past and on our knowledge of the system we are tracking and on the characteristics of the sensors. The Kalman filter was invented by Rudolf Emil Kálmán to solve this sort of problem in a mathematically optimal way. Its first use was on the Apollo missions to the moon, and since then it has been used in an enormous variety of domains. There are Kalman filters in aircraft, on submarines, and on cruise missiles. Wall street uses them to track the market. They are used in robots, in IoT (Internet of Things) sensors, and in laboratory instruments. Chemical plants use them to control and monitor reactions. They are used to perform medical imaging and to remove noise from cardiac signals. If it involves a sensor and/or time-series data, a Kalman filter or a close relative to the Kalman filter is usually involved. Motivation The motivation for this book came out of my desire for a gentle introduction to Kalman filtering. I'm a software engineer that spent almost two decades in the avionics field, and so I have always been 'bumping elbows' with the Kalman filter, but never implemented one myself. As I moved into solving tracking problems with computer vision the need became urgent. There are classic textbooks in the field, such as Grewal and Andrew's excellent Kalman Filtering . But sitting down and trying to read many of these books is a dismal experience if you do not have the required background. Typically the first few chapters fly through several years of undergraduate math, blithely referring you to textbooks on topics such as Itō calculus, and present an entire semester's worth of statistics in a few brief paragraphs. They are good texts for an upper undergraduate course, and an invaluable reference to researchers and professionals, but the going is truly difficult for the more casual reader. Symbology is introduced without explanation, different texts use different terms and variables for the same concept, and the books are almost devoid of examples or worked problems. I often found myself able to parse the words and comprehend the mathematics of a definition, but had no idea as to what real world phenomena they describe. ""But what does that mean? "" was my repeated thought. However, as I began to finally understand the Kalman filter I realized the underlying concepts are quite straightforward. A few simple probability rules, some intuition about how we integrate disparate knowledge to explain events in our everyday life and the core concepts of the Kalman filter are accessible. Kalman filters have a reputation for difficulty, but shorn of much of the formal terminology the beauty of the subject and of their math became clear to me, and I fell in love with the topic. As I began to understand the math and theory more difficulties present themselves. A book or paper's author makes some statement of fact and presents a graph as proof.  Unfortunately, why the statement is true is not clear to me, nor is the method for making that plot obvious. Or maybe I wonder ""is this true if R=0?""  Or the author provides pseudocode at such a high level that the implementation is not obvious. Some books offer Matlab code, but I do not have a license to that expensive package. Finally, many books end each chapter with many useful exercises. Exercises which you need to understand if you want to implement Kalman filters for yourself, but exercises with no answers. If you are using the book in a classroom, perhaps this is okay, but it is terrible for the independent reader. I loathe that an author withholds information from me, presumably to avoid 'cheating' by the student in the classroom. From my point of view none of this is necessary. Certainly if you are designing a Kalman filter for an aircraft or missile you must thoroughly master all of the mathematics and topics in a typical Kalman filter textbook. I just want to track an image on a screen, or write some code for an Arduino project. I want to know how the plots in the book are made, and chose different parameters than the author chose. I want to run simulations. I want to inject more noise in the signal and see how a filter performs. There are thousands of opportunities for using Kalman filters in everyday code, and yet this fairly straightforward topic is the provenance of rocket scientists and academics. I wrote this book to address all of those needs. This is not the book for you if you program navigation computers for Boeing or design radars for Raytheon. Go get an advanced degree at Georgia Tech, UW, or the like, because you'll need it. This book is for the hobbyist, the curious, and the working engineer that needs to filter or smooth data. This book is interactive. While you can read it online as static content, I urge you to use it as intended. It is written using Jupyter Notebook, which allows me to combine text, math, Python, and Python output in one place. Every plot, every piece of data in this book is generated from Python that is available to you right inside the notebook. Want to double the value of a parameter? Click on the Python cell, change the parameter's value, and click 'Run'. A new plot or printed output will appear in the book. This book has exercises, but it also has the answers. I trust you. If you just need an answer, go ahead and read the answer. If you want to internalize this knowledge, try to implement the exercise before you read the answer. This book has supporting libraries for computing statistics, plotting various things related to filters, and for the various filters that we cover. This does require a strong caveat; most of the code is written for didactic purposes. It is rare that I chose the most efficient solution (which often obscures the intent of the code), and in the first parts of the book I did not concern myself with numerical stability. This is important to understand - Kalman filters in aircraft are carefully designed and implemented to be numerically stable; the naive implementation is not stable in many cases. If you are serious about Kalman filters this book will not be the last book you need. My intention is to introduce you to the concepts and mathematics, and to get you to the point where the textbooks are approachable. Finally, this book is free. The cost for the books required to learn Kalman filtering is somewhat prohibitive even for a Silicon Valley engineer like myself; I cannot believe they are within the reach of someone in a depressed economy, or a financially struggling student. I have gained so much from free software like Python, and free books like those from Allen B. Downey here . It's time to repay that. So, the book is free, it is hosted on free servers, and it uses only free and open software such as IPython and MathJax to create the book. Reading Online The book is written as a collection of Jupyter Notebooks, an interactive, browser based system that allows you to combine text, Python, and math into your browser. There are multiple ways to read these online, listed below. binder binder serves interactive notebooks online, so you can run the code and change the code within your browser without downloading the book or installing Jupyter. nbviewer The website http://nbviewer.org provides a Jupyter Notebook server that renders notebooks stored at github (or elsewhere). The rendering is done in real time when you load the book. You may use this nbviewer link to access my book via nbviewer. If you read my book today, and then I make a change tomorrow, when you go back tomorrow you will see that change. Notebooks are rendered statically - you can read them, but not modify or run the code. nbviewer seems to lag the checked in version by a few days, so you might not be reading the most recent content. GitHub GitHub is able to render the notebooks directly. The quickest way to view a notebook is to just click on them above. However, it renders the math incorrectly, and I cannot recommend using it if you are doing more than just dipping into the book. PDF Version A PDF version of the book is available [here] https://drive.google.com/file/d/0By_SW19c1BfhSVFzNHc0SjduNzg/view?usp=sharing&resourcekey=0-41olC9ht9xE3wQe2zHZ45A ) The PDF will usually lag behind what is in github as I don't update it for every minor check in. Downloading and Running the Book However, this book is intended to be interactive and I recommend using it in that form. It's a little more effort to set up, but worth it. If you install IPython and some supporting libraries on your computer and then clone this book you will be able to run all of the code in the book yourself. You can perform experiments, see how filters react to different data, see how different filters react to the same data, and so on. I find this sort of immediate feedback both vital and invigorating. You do not have to wonder ""what happens if"". Try it and see! The book and supporting software can be downloaded from GitHub by running this command on  the command line: git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/rlabbe/Kalman-and-Bayesian-Filters-in-Python.git
pip install filterpy Instructions for installation of the IPython ecosystem can be found in the Installation appendix, found here . Once the software is installed you can navigate to the installation directory and run Jupyter notebook with the command line instruction jupyter notebook This will open a browser window showing the contents of the base directory. The book is organized into chapters, each contained within one IPython Notebook (these notebook files have a .ipynb file extension). For example, to read Chapter 2, click on the file 02-Discrete-Bayes.ipynb . Sometimes there are supporting notebooks for doing things like generating animations that are displayed in the chapter. These are not intended to be read by the end user, but of course if you are curious as to how an animation is made go ahead and take a look. You can find these notebooks in the folder named Supporting_Notebooks . This is admittedly a somewhat cumbersome interface to a book; I am following in the footsteps of several other projects that are somewhat repurposing Jupyter Notebook to generate entire books. I feel the slight annoyances have a huge payoff - instead of having to download a separate code base and run it in an IDE while you try to read a book, all of the code and text is in one place. If you want to alter the code, you may do so and immediately see the effects of your change. If you find a bug, you can make a fix, and push it back to my repository so that everyone in the world benefits. And, of course, you will never encounter a problem I face all the time with traditional books - the book and the code are out of sync with each other, and you are left scratching your head as to which source to trust. Companion Software I wrote an open source Bayesian filtering Python library called FilterPy . I have made the project available on PyPi, the Python Package Index.  To install from PyPi, at the command line issue the command pip install filterpy If you do not have pip, you may follow the instructions here: https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/installing.html . All of the filters used in this book as well as others not in this book are implemented in my Python library FilterPy, available here . You do not need to download or install this to read the book, but you will likely want to use this library to write your own filters. It includes Kalman filters, Fading Memory filters, H infinity filters, Extended and Unscented filters, least square filters, and many more.  It also includes helper routines that simplify the designing the matrices used by some of the filters, and other code such as Kalman based smoothers. FilterPy is hosted on github at ( https://github.com/rlabbe/filterpy ).  If you want the bleeding edge release you will want to grab a copy from github, and follow your Python installation's instructions for adding it to the Python search path. This might expose you to some instability since you might not get a tested release, but as a benefit you will also get all of the test scripts used to test the library. You can examine these scripts to see many examples of writing and running filters while not in the Jupyter Notebook environment. Alternative Way of Running the Book in Conda environment If you have conda or miniconda installed, you can create an environment by conda env update -f environment.yml and use conda activate kf_bf and conda deactivate kf_bf to activate and deactivate the environment. Issues or Questions If you have comments, you can write an issue at GitHub so that everyone can read it along with my response. Please don't view it as a way to report bugs only. Alternatively I've created a gitter room for more informal discussion. License Kalman and Bayesian Filters in Python by Roger R.

These algorithms will make it easier for the research community to replicate, refine, and identify new ideas, and will create good baselines to build research on top of. Our DQN implementation and its variants are roughly on par with the scores in published papers. We expect they will be used as a base around which new ideas can be added, and as a tool for comparing a new approach against existing ones. Prerequisites Baselines requires python3 (>=3.5) with the development headers. You'll also need system packages CMake, OpenMPI and zlib. Those can be installed as follows Ubuntu sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install cmake libopenmpi-dev python3-dev zlib1g-dev Mac OS X Installation of system packages on Mac requires Homebrew . With Homebrew installed, run the following: brew install cmake openmpi Virtual environment From the general python package sanity perspective, it is a good idea to use virtual environments (virtualenvs) to make sure packages from different projects do not interfere with each other. You can install virtualenv (which is itself a pip package) via pip install virtualenv Virtualenvs are essentially folders that have copies of python executable and all python packages.
To create a virtualenv called venv with python3, one runs virtualenv /path/to/venv --python=python3 To activate a virtualenv: . /path/to/venv/bin/activate More thorough tutorial on virtualenvs and options can be found here Tensorflow versions The master branch supports Tensorflow from version 1.4 to 1.14. For Tensorflow 2.0 support, please use tf2 branch. Installation Clone the repo and cd into it: git clone https://github.com/openai/baselines.git cd baselines If you don't have TensorFlow installed already, install your favourite flavor of TensorFlow. In most cases, you may use pip install tensorflow-gpu==1.14 # if you have a CUDA-compatible gpu and proper drivers or pip install tensorflow==1.14 to install Tensorflow 1.14, which is the latest version of Tensorflow supported by the master branch. Refer to TensorFlow installation guide for more details. Install baselines package pip install -e . MuJoCo Some of the baselines examples use MuJoCo (multi-joint dynamics in contact) physics simulator, which is proprietary and requires binaries and a license (temporary 30-day license can be obtained from www.mujoco.org ). Instructions on setting up MuJoCo can be found here Testing the installation All unit tests in baselines can be run using pytest runner: pip install pytest
pytest Training models Most of the algorithms in baselines repo are used as follows: python -m baselines.run --alg= < name of the algorithm > --env= < environment_id > [additional arguments] Example 1. PPO with MuJoCo Humanoid For instance, to train a fully-connected network controlling MuJoCo humanoid using PPO2 for 20M timesteps python -m baselines.run --alg=ppo2 --env=Humanoid-v2 --network=mlp --num_timesteps=2e7 Note that for mujoco environments fully-connected network is default, so we can omit --network=mlp The hyperparameters for both network and the learning algorithm can be controlled via the command line, for instance: python -m baselines.run --alg=ppo2 --env=Humanoid-v2 --network=mlp --num_timesteps=2e7 --ent_coef=0.1 --num_hidden=32 --num_layers=3 --value_network=copy will set entropy coefficient to 0.1, and construct fully connected network with 3 layers with 32 hidden units in each, and create a separate network for value function estimation (so that its parameters are not shared with the policy network, but the structure is the same) See docstrings in common/models.py for description of network parameters for each type of model, and
docstring for baselines/ppo2/ppo2.py/learn() for the description of the ppo2 hyperparameters. Example 2. DQN on Atari DQN with Atari is at this point a classics of benchmarks. To run the baselines implementation of DQN on Atari Pong: python -m baselines.run --alg=deepq --env=PongNoFrameskip-v4 --num_timesteps=1e6 Saving, loading and visualizing models Saving and loading the model The algorithms serialization API is not properly unified yet; however, there is a simple method to save / restore trained models. --save_path and --load_path command-line option loads the tensorflow state from a given path before training, and saves it after the training, respectively.
Let's imagine you'd like to train ppo2 on Atari Pong,  save the model and then later visualize what has it learnt. python -m baselines.run --alg=ppo2 --env=PongNoFrameskip-v4 --num_timesteps=2e7 --save_path= ~ /models/pong_20M_ppo2 This should get to the mean reward per episode about 20. To load and visualize the model, we'll do the following - load the model, train it for 0 steps, and then visualize: python -m baselines.run --alg=ppo2 --env=PongNoFrameskip-v4 --num_timesteps=0 --load_path= ~ /models/pong_20M_ppo2 --play NOTE: Mujoco environments require normalization to work properly, so we wrap them with VecNormalize wrapper. Currently, to ensure the models are saved with normalization (so that trained models can be restored and run without further training) the normalization coefficients are saved as tensorflow variables. This can decrease the performance somewhat, so if you require high-throughput steps with Mujoco and do not need saving/restoring the models, it may make sense to use numpy normalization instead. To do that, set 'use_tf=False` in baselines/run.py . Logging and vizualizing learning curves and other training metrics By default, all summary data, including progress, standard output, is saved to a unique directory in a temp folder, specified by a call to Python's tempfile.gettempdir() .
The directory can be changed with the --log_path command-line option. python -m baselines.run --alg=ppo2 --env=PongNoFrameskip-v4 --num_timesteps=2e7 --save_path= ~ /models/pong_20M_ppo2 --log_path= ~ /logs/Pong/ NOTE: Please be aware that the logger will overwrite files of the same name in an existing directory, thus it's recommended that folder names be given a unique timestamp to prevent overwritten logs. Another way the temp directory can be changed is through the use of the $OPENAI_LOGDIR environment variable. For examples on how to load and display the training data, see here . Subpackages A2C ACER ACKTR DDPG DQN GAIL HER PPO1 (obsolete version, left here temporarily) PPO2 TRPO Benchmarks Results of benchmarks on Mujoco (1M timesteps) and Atari (10M timesteps) are available here for Mujoco and here for Atari respectively. Note that these results may be not on the latest version of the code, particular commit hash with which results were obtained is specified on the benchmarks page.

Reinforcement learning (RL) is a type of machine learning process in which autonomous agents learn to make decisions by interacting with their environment. An autonomous agent is any system that can make decisions and act in response to its environment independent of direct instruction by a human user. Robots and self-driving cars are examples of autonomous agents. In reinforcement learning, autonomous agents learn to perform a task by trial and error in the absence of any guidance from a human user. 1 It particularly addresses sequential decision-making problems in uncertain environments, and shows promise in artificial intelligence development. Supervised and unsupervised learning Literature often contrasts reinforcement learning with supervised and unsupervised learning. Supervised learning uses manually labeled data to produce predictions or classifications. Unsupervised learning aims to uncover and learn hidden patterns from unlabeled data. In contrast to supervised learning, reinforcement learning does not use labeled examples of correct or incorrect behavior. But reinforcement learning also differs from unsupervised learning in that reinforcement learning learns by trial-and-error and reward function rather than by extracting information of hidden patterns. 2 Supervised and unsupervised learning methods assume each record of input data is independent of other records in the dataset but that each record actualizes a common underlying data distribution model. These methods learn to predict with model performance measured according to prediction accuracy maximization. By contrast, reinforcement learning learns to act. It assumes input data to be interdependent tuples—i.e. an ordered sequence of data—organized as state-action-reward. Many applications of reinforcement learning algorithms aim to mimic real-world biological learning methods through positive reinforcement. Note that, although the two are not often compared in literature, reinforcement learning is distinct from self-supervised learning as well. The latter is a form of unsupervised learning that uses pseudo labels derived from unlabeled training data as a ground truth to measure model accuracy. Reinforcement learning, however, does not produce pseudo labels or measure against a ground truth—it is not a classification method but an action learner. The two have been combined however with promising results. 3 Industry newsletter The latest AI trends, brought to you by experts Get curated insights on the most important—and intriguing—AI news.

Reinforcement learning process Reinforcement learning essentially consists of the relationship between an agent, environment, and goal. Literature widely formulates this relationship in terms of the Markov decision process (MDP). Markov decision process The reinforcement learning agent learns about a problem by interacting with its environment. The environment provides information on its current state. The agent then uses that information to determine which actions(s) to take. If that action obtains a reward signal from the surrounding environment, the agent is encouraged to take that action again when in a similar future state. This process repeats for every new state thereafter. Over time, the agent learns from rewards and punishments to take actions within the environment that meet a specified goal. 4 In Markov decision processes, state space refers to all of the information provided by an environment’s state. Action space denotes all possible actions the agent may take within a state. 5 Exploration-exploitation trade-off Because an RL agent has no manually labeled input data guiding its behavior, it must explore its environment, attempting new actions to discover those that receive rewards. From these reward signals, the agent learns to prefer actions for which it was rewarded in order to maximize its gain. But the agent must continue exploring new states and actions as well. In doing so, it can then use that experience to improve its decision-making. RL algorithms thus require an agent to both exploit knowledge of previously rewarded state-actions and explore other state-actions. The agent cannot exclusively pursue exploration or exploitation. It must continuously try new actions while also preferring single (or chains of) actions that produce the largest cumulative reward. 6 Components of reinforcement learning Beyond the agent-environment-goal triumvirate, four principal sub-elements characterize reinforcement learning problems. - Policy. This defines the RL agent’s behavior by mapping perceived environmental states to specific actions the agent must take when in those states. It can take the form of a rudimentary function or more involved computational process. For instance, a policy guiding an autonomous vehicle may map pedestrian detection to a stop action. - Reward signal. This designates the RL problem’s goal. Each of the RL agent’s actions either receives a reward from the environment or not. The agent’s only objective is to maximize its cumulative rewards from the environment. For self-driving vehicles, the reward signal can be reduced travel time, decreased collisions, remaining on the road and in the proper lane, avoiding extreme de- or accelerations, and so forth. This example shows RL may incorporate multiple reward signals to guide an agent. - Value function. Reward signal differs from value function in that the former denotes immediate benefit while the latter specifies long-term benefit. Value refers to a state’s desirability per all of the states (with their incumbent rewards) that are likely to follow. An autonomous vehicle may be able to reduce travel time by exiting its lane, driving on the sidewalk, and accelerating quickly, but these latter three actions may reduce its overall value function. Thus, the vehicle as an RL agent may exchange marginally longer travel time to increase its reward in the latter three areas. - Model. This is an optional sub-element of reinforcement learning systems. Models allow agents to predict environment behavior for possible actions. Agents then use model predictions to determine possible courses of action based on potential outcomes. This can be the model guiding the autonomous vehicle and that helps it predict best routes, what to expect from surrounding vehicles given their position and speed, and so forth. 7 Some model-based approaches use direct human feedback in initial learning and then shift to autonomous leanring. Online versus offline learning There are two general methods by which an agent collects data for learning policies: - Online. Here, an agent collects data directly from interacting with its surrounding environment. This data is processed and collected iteratively as the agent continues interacting with that environment. - Offline. When an agent does not have direct access to an environment, it can learn through logged data of that environment. This is offline learning. A large subset of research has turned to offline learning given practical difficulties in training models through direct interaction with environments. 8 Types of reinforcement learning Reinforcement learning is a vibrant, ongoing area of research, and as such, developers have produced a myriad approaches to reinforcement learning. Nevertheless, three widely discussed and foundational reinforcement learning methods are dynamic programming, monte carlo, and temporal difference learning. Dynamic programming Dynamic programming breaks down larger tasks into smaller tasks. Thus, it models problems as workflows of sequential decision made at discrete time steps. Each decision is made in terms of the resulting possible next state. An agent’s reward ( r ) for a given action is defined as a function of that action ( a ), the current environmental state ( s ), and the potential next state ( s’ ): This reward function can be used as (part of) the policy governing an agent’s actions. Determining the optimal policy for agent behavior is a chief component of dynamic programming methods for reinforcement learning. Enter the Bellman equation. The Bellman equation is: In short, this equation defines v t (s) as the total expected reward starting at time t until the end of a decision workflow. It assumes that the agent begins by occupying state s at time t . The equation ultimately divides the reward at time t into the immediate reward r t (s,a) (i.e. the reward formula) and the agent’s total expected reward. An agent thus maximizes its value function—being the total value of the Bellman equation—by consistently choosing that action which receives a reward signal in each state. 9 Monte Carlo method Dynamic programming is model-based, meaning it constructs a model of its environment to perceive rewards, identify patterns, and navigate the environment. Monte Carlo , however, assumes a black-box environment, making it model-free. While dynamic programming predicts potential future states and reward signals in making decisions, Monte Carlo methods are exclusively experience-based, meaning they sample sequences of states, actions, and rewards solely through interaction with the environment. Monte Carlo methods thus learn through trial and error rather than probabilistic distributions. Monte Carlo further differs from dynamic programming in value function determination. Dynamic programming seeks the largest cumulative reward by consistently selecting rewarded actions in successive states. Monte Carlo, by contrast, averages the returns for each state–action pair. This, in turn, means that the Monte Carlo method must wait until all actions in a given episode (or planning horizon) have been completed before calculating its value function, and then updating its policy. 10 Temporal difference learning Literature widely describes temporal difference (TD) learning as a combination of dynamic programming and Monte Carlo. As in the former, TD updates its policy, and so estimates for future states, after each step without waiting for a final value. As in Monte Carlo, however, TD learns through raw interaction with its environment rather than using a model thereof. 11 Per its name, the TD learning agent revises its policy according to the difference between predicted and actual received rewards in each state. That is, while dynamic programming and Monte Carlo only consider the reward received, TD further weighs the difference between its expectation and received reward. Using this difference, the agent updates its estimates for the next step without waiting until the event planning horizon, contra Monte Carlo. 12 TD has many variations. Two prominent variations are State–action–reward–state–action (SARSA) and Q-learning. SARSA is an on-policy TD method, meaning it evaluates and attempts to improve its decision-governing policy. Q-learning is off-policy. Off-policy methods are those that use two policies: one for exploitation (target policy) and one for exploration to generate behavior (behavior policy). 13 Additional methods There is a myriad of additional reinforcement learning methods. Dynamic programming is a value-based method, meaning it selects actions based on their estimated values according to a policy that aims to maximize its value function. By contrast, policy gradient methods learn a parameterized policy that can select actions without consulting a value function. These are called policy-based and are considered more effective in high-dimensional environments. 14 Actor-critic methods use both value-based and policy-based. The so-called “actor” is a policy gradient determining which actions to take, while the “critic” is a value function to evaluate actions. Actor-critic methods are, essentially, a form of TD. More specifically, actor-critic evaluates a given action’s value based not only on its own reward but the possible value of the following state, which it adds to the action’s reward. Actor-critic’s advantage is that, due to its implementation of a value function and policy in decision-making, it effectively requires less environment interaction. 15 Mixture of Experts | 5 December, episode 84 Decoding AI: Weekly News Roundup Join our world-class panel of engineers, researchers, product leaders and more as they cut through the AI noise to bring you the latest in AI news and insights. Watch all episodes of Mixture of Experts Examples of reinforcement learning Robotics Given reinforcement learning is centrally concerned with decision-making in unpredictable environments, it has been a core area of interest in robotics. For accomplishing simple and repetitive tasks , decision-making may be straightforward. But more complicated tasks, such as attempts to simulate human behavior or automate driving, involve interaction with high-variable and mutable real-world environments. Research shows deep reinforcement learning with deep neural networks aids such tasks, especially with respect to generalization and mapping high-dimensionally sensory input to controlled systems outputs. 16 Studies suggest that deep reinforcement learning with robots relies heavily on collected datasets, and so recent work explores avenues for collecting real-world data 17 and repurposing prior data 18 to improve reinforcement learning systems. Natural language processing Recent research suggests leveraging natural language processing techniques and tools—e.g. large language models (LLMs) —may improve generalization in reinforcement learning systems through textual representation of real-world environments. 19 Many studies show how interactive textual environments provide cost-effective alternatives to three-dimensional environments when instructing learning agents in successive decision-making tasks. 20 Deep reinforcement learning also undergirds textual decision-making in chatbots . In fact, reinforcement learning outperforms other methods for improving chatbot dialogue response. 21 Link copied Report IBM is named a Leader in Data Science & Machine Learning Learn why IBM has been recognized as a Leader in the 2025 Gartner® Magic Quadrant™ for Data Science and Machine Learning Platforms.

Refer to our IBM Privacy Statement for more information. https://www.ibm.com/us-en/privacy How do neural networks work? On a high level, the inspiration for neural networks comes from the biological neurons in the human brain, which communicate through electrical signals. In 1943, Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts proposed the first mathematical model of a neuron, showing that simple units could perform computation of a function. Later, in 1958, Frank Rosenblatt introduced the perceptron, an algorithm designed to perform pattern recognition. The perceptron is the historical ancestor of today’s networks: essentially a linear model with a constrained output. In the following section, we will dive into how neural networks borrow inspiration from the human brains to make decisions and recognize patterns. A neural network can be understood through a simple example: spam detection. An email is fed into the network, and features such as words or phrases like “prize,” “money,” “dear” or “win” are used as inputs. The early neurons in the network process the importance of each signal, while later layers combine this information into higher-level cues that capture context and tone. The final layer then computes a probability of whether the email is spam, and if that probability is high enough, the email is flagged. In essence, the network learns how to transform raw features into meaningful patterns and use them to make predictions. This process is powered by two fundamental concepts: weights and biases. Weights act like dials that control how strongly each input feature influences the decision—a word like “prize” may be given more weight than a common word like “hello.” Biases are built-in values that shift the decision threshold, allowing a neuron to activate even if the inputs themselves are weak. Together, these model parameters determine how each neuron contributes to the overall computation. By adjusting these values during training, the network gradually learns to make accurate predictions—in this case, whether an email is spam or not. Mathematically, a neural network learns a function f ( X ) by mapping an input vector X = ( x 1 , x 2 , x 3. . . ) to a predict a response Y . What distinguishes neural networks from other traditional machine learning algorithms is their layered structure and their ability to perform nonlinear transformation. A neural network is comprised of: Input layer : holds the raw features ( X 1 , X 2 , X 3 , . . ) . Hidden layers : consist of artificial neurons (or nodes) that transform inputs into new representations. Mathematically, hidden layers are expressed as the input features, multiplied by their associated weights and added bias to pass from one layer to the next layer, eventually arriving at the final output layer. This is where the linear transformation between input and output happens. Output layer : After performing the linear transformation in the hidden layer, a nonlinear activation function (tanh, sigmoid, ReLU ) is added to produce the final prediction (such as a number for regression, or a probability distribution for classification). Neural network training Just like other machine learning algorithms, a neural net requires rigorous training to perform well on testing. To train a network, a single neuron computes: z = ∑ i = 1 n w i x i + b a = σ ( z ) Where: x i = input feature, w i = weight, b = bias, z = weighted sum (linear transformation), σ = activation function (nonlinear transformation), a = output, σ represents an activation function at the output layer that transforms the linear combination to fit the decision of the function. Using this architecture, the input features X are transformed into an output Y, serving as a predictive machine learning model. The power of a neural network comes from its ability to learn the right weights and biases from data. This is done by comparing the network’s prediction Y ^ to the true label Y and measuring the error using a loss function . For example, in classification tasks, the loss might measure how far the predicted probability is from the correct answer. To minimize this loss, the network uses an algorithm called backpropagation . The neural net trains in four steps: Forward pass: Inputs flow through the network, computing linear combinations, passing through the nonlinear activation function and producing an output prediction. Error calculation: The loss function measures the difference between prediction and truth. Backward pass (backpropagation): The error is propagated backward through the network. At each neuron, the algorithm calculates how much each weight and bias contributed to the error using the chain rule of calculus. Weight update: The weights and biases are adjusted slightly in the direction that reduces the error, using an optimization method like gradient descent . This process is repeated many times over the training dataset. Each pass helps the network “tune” its internal parameters so that its predictions get incrementally closer to the correct answers. Over time, the network converges to a set of weights and biases that minimize error and generalize well to unseen data. Backpropagation, coupled with gradient descent, is the engine that makes neural networks work. It enables networks with millions (or even billions) of parameters to learn meaningful patterns from massive datasets. However, despite practitioners’ effort to train high performing models, neural networks still face challenges similar to other machine learning models—most significantly, overfitting. When a neural network becomes overly complex with too many parameters, the model will overfit to the training data and predict poorly. Overfitting is a common problem in all kinds of neural networks, and paying close attention to bias-variance tradeoff is paramount to creating high-performing neural network models. Modern neural network architectures—such as transformers and encoder-decoder models—follow the same core principles (learned weights and biases, stacked layers, nonlinear activations, end-to-end training by backpropagation). They differ mainly in how inputs are mixed across layers. Instead of fully connected mixing alone, transformers use attention to form data-dependent weighted combinations of representations, alongside residual connections, normalization and positional encodings to enrich wiring built on the same fundamentals. Types of neural networks While multilayer perceptrons are the foundation, neural networks have evolved into specialized architectures suited for different domains: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs or convnets): Designed for grid-like data such as images. CNNs excel at image recognition, computer vision and facial recognition thanks to convolutional filters that detect spatial hierarchies of features. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) : Incorporate feedback loops that allow information to persist across time steps. RNNs are well-suited for speech recognition, time series forecasting and sequential data. Transformers: A modern architecture that replaced RNNs for many sequence tasks. Transformers leverage attention mechanisms to capture dependencies in natural language processing (NLP) and power state-of-the-art models like GPT. These variations highlight the versatility of neural networks. Regardless of architecture, all rely on the same principles: artificial neurons, nonlinear activations and optimization algorithms.

Watch all episodes of Mixture of Experts Neural network applications Neural networks underpin many of today’s AI systems. Some prominent applications of neural networks include: Computer vision: CNNs for image recognition, medical imaging and autonomous vehicles. Natural language processing: Transformers for machine translation, chatbots and summarization. Speech recognition: RNNs and deep nets for transcription and voice assistants. Forecasting and time series: Demand prediction, financial modeling and weather forecasting. Reinforcement learning : Neural nets as function approximators in game-playing agents (for example, Deepmind’s go-playing AlphaGo). Pattern recognition: Identifying fraud, detecting anomalies, or classifying documents. These applications drive real-world innovations in healthcare, finance, robotics, entertainment and beyond. Why neural networks matter Neural networks learn useful internal representations directly from data, capturing nonlinear structure that classical models miss. With sufficient capacity, sound objectives and regularization against overfitting, they scale from small benchmarks to production systems in computer vision, natural language processing, speech recognition, forecasting and more—delivering measurable gains in accuracy and robustness. Modern deep learning extends these foundations. CNNs specialize in spatial feature extraction for images; RNNs model temporal dependencies in sequences; transformers replace recurrence with attention, aided by residual connections, normalization and efficient parallelism on GPUs. Despite architectural differences, training remains end-to-end with backpropagation on large datasets, and the core view still holds: Y = f ( X ; σ ) is learned by composing data-dependent transformations with nonlinear activations. Generative AI builds on the same principles at greater scale. Large language models , diffusion models, VAEs and GANs learn distributions over data to synthesize text, images, audio and code. The leap from a multilayer perceptron to state-of-the-art generators is primarily one of architecture, data and compute. Understanding activation functions, training requirements and the main types of networks provides a practical bridge from classical neural nets to today’s generative systems and clarifies why these models have become central to modern AI.

We got our start in late 2016 with the first browser-based text-to-image generator (and some other generative tools). Since then, we have greatly expanded: with a single prompt, you can generate images, edit photos, chat with an AI that browses the internet, create short videos, compose original music, or chat with a realistic AI using your voice. All of these features are available instantly in your browser, and many are available through simple APIs. You can explore DeepAI for free without creating an account. DeepAI Pro costs $4.99 per month and includes high-volume usage, private generations, and an ad-free experience, which we proudly feel is one of the best deals on the market. We are committed to radical accessibility. Our platform provides fast tools, real email support for every user, and a clear policy that gives you full ownership of everything you create. Whether you are a hobbyist, a professional artist, or a developer integrating AI into your product, DeepAI delivers advanced technology with new video, music, and voice chat features. No competitor matches our combination of price, features, and ease of use. Beyond our consumer platform, we also take on custom technical projects for governments, nonprofits, and research organizations. Our team builds specialized computer vision systems, deploys perception and mapping pipelines across complex sensor networks, and solves challenging real-world problems that require production-grade AI solutions. If you have a unique technical challenge, we're equipped to help. AI for Good Beyond making AI accessible to creators worldwide, we believe in using our technology to solve real-world problems and support communities in need. Our ""AI for Good"" initiative reflects our commitment to environmental stewardship, conservation, and social impact. We've deployed advanced computer vision and sensor systems for critical conservation projects across the globe. Our technology analyzes satellite imagery, drone footage, aerial photography, and camera trap data to protect biodiversity and monitor environmental change. These systems use modern transformer-based detectors and lightweight CNNs optimized for different sensors and compute environments—from edge devices in remote locations to country-scale processing pipelines. All projects were delivered on time with measurable real-world impact. African Wildlife Protection Working with Wildlife Protection Solutions , we built multi-source detection systems to monitor endangered species across African reserves using camera trap networks and aerial imagery. The system generates real-time population estimates, movement patterns, and hotspot maps that cut field-team response time by 40%. This allows conservation teams to deploy resources more effectively and respond faster to threats like poaching. Island Conservation Initiatives For the Catalina Island Conservancy , we developed species detection and distribution mapping systems using drone and camera-trap data across different habitat types. The resulting management-ready GIS layers accelerated habitat restoration planning by one full season, allowing the conservancy to prioritize restoration zones based on data-driven species presence analysis. Similarly, we collaborated with the Kauaʻi Forest Bird Recovery Project at the University of Hawaiʻi (working with Hawaiʻi DLNR ) to monitor threatened forest bird populations in remote terrain. By processing survey imagery and camera-trap sequences, we delivered detection datasets and habitat overlays that inform ongoing conservation decisions for these critically endangered species. Federal Conservation Programs Supporting the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's Pacific Islands Fish and Wildlife Office , we deployed detection and trend-analysis pipelines across multi-year imagery archives to monitor endangered species across island habitats. The system produces count trends, change detection analysis, and management maps that directly inform federal protection actions and recovery strategies. UAE Nationwide Environmental Survey We partnered with the Federal Competitiveness and Statistics Authority to create the first machine-verified, nationwide inventory of palm trees and greenery from satellite imagery. Processing over 2.4 million satellite images, we delivered a complete country-wide survey in just 4 weeks—a task that would have taken 6 months using traditional methods. The system geolocated over 200,000 individual palm trees and calculated precise greenery surface area estimates (in m²), providing executive-ready data for national policy and environmental planning. Survey costs were reduced by 60-80% compared to manual methods. Planetary Defense We even contributed to space science through the International Astronomical Search Collaboration , building automated candidate discovery systems for asteroid identification from telescope image sequences. Our moving-object detection system expanded their search capacity by 3×, helping identify potential near-Earth objects. These projects demonstrate how responsible AI can shorten the observation-to-action loop. Faster detection means faster response. Lower costs mean broader coverage. Automated systems free experts to focus on decisions rather than data processing—and real conservation outcomes follow. Uplifting People Around the World We also support communities facing unique challenges. In 2025, DeepAI became the major sponsor of Tuvalu's national futsal team , helping them return to international competition after a 14-year absence. Despite training on an airport runway due to limited infrastructure and facing the realities of climate vulnerability, the team's determination inspired us. This is what AI for Good means to us—using technology and resources to create opportunities and inspire hope, whether through conservation science or grassroots sports development. At DeepAI, we're building tools that democratize creativity while actively contributing to a better world. That's the kind of company we want to be. © 2017-2025 Deep AI, Inc. All rights reserved.

For years, the focus was on building a single, powerful model capable of tackling any task thrown its way. But as the complexity of our problems grows, it's becoming clear that a lone genius, no matter how brilliant, can be outmatched by a well-coordinated team of specialists. This is the paradigm shift that brings us to multi-agent AI systems.      
    A Multi-Agent System (MAS) is a team of specialized AI agents that collaborate to tackle  complex problems. Use a multi-agent system when your challenge involves multiple tasks, dynamic environments, or specialized expertise that require agent coordination and agent communication. For simpler or well-defined workflows, a single intelligent agent or structured agentic workflow is often a better, faster, and more cost-efficient choice. The golden rule is to use the simplest setup that effectively solves your problem. Physical AI AI Robotics: A Field Report on Imitation Learning with LeRobot Executive Summary   
    In this report, the ML6 Robotics   AI team presents our experience preparing, executing, and evaluating two imitation learning use cases with different levels of complexity on custom datasets using the LeRobot framework. These learnings inspired us to join the 2025 LeRobot Hackathon and create a podium-finishing submission (team 297). Agentic AI The Smartest Buy Yet: How AI Is Redefining the Future of Procurement Executive Summary   
   The article explains how Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming procurement from a tactical, manual function into a strategic driver of value, innovation, and resilience. By leveraging technologies such as machine learning, natural language processing, and Generative AI, organizations can automate and optimize every stage of the procurement lifecycle—from intelligent sourcing and supplier risk management to contract analysis and the procure-to-pay (P2P) process. The rise of integrated “Agentic AI” systems enables end-to-end workflow automation, predictive risk detection, and data-driven decision-making, while maintaining a human-in-the-loop approach to ensure strategic oversight. Ultimately, AI empowers procurement teams to reduce costs, improve efficiency, and proactively manage risks, positioning the function as a key enabler of organizational competitiveness and agility. Agentic AI Autonomous AI LLM Engineering MCP and AI Agents: The Next Big Shift in Engineering Workflows Executive Summary     ML6 went to the AI Engineer summit in Paris. We are confident that agents will remain a vital part of the industry, and MCP will be at the forefront of this trend. While MCP adoption is skyrocketing, its potential remains heavily underutilized. And while many agent projects are still explorative, those that find a suitable use case can radically transform their processes through iterative engineering. Superintelligence Letter from the CEO — How we went from Big Data to Superintelligence The rise of Big Data 
 I want to take you back to  2012 . In those early years, our focus was  big data,  and everyone else was looking at the cloud. We were pioneering, but in a world that was still beginning to understand the value of data. The Visual Renaissance: AI-powered content creation in consumer industries Executive Summary     AI is ushering in a “Visual Renaissance” that is transforming how consumer industries create and scale content. Beyond speeding up ideation and prototyping, AI-generated visuals enable hyper-personalization, dynamic content ecosystems, and streamlined global localization. Businesses face a trade-off between flexible off-the-shelf tools and precise but resource-intensive custom models. While the technology promises faster, more cost-effective, and tailored content, it also raises challenges around ethics, copyright, and brand control. The future lies in combining AI’s efficiency with human creativity and oversight, redefining how brands tell stories and engage consumers. The 8-Year Wait: How ML6 Tackled Grid Congestion at Elia’s “Hack The Grid 2025” Executive Summary   Join ML6 on our three-day journey at Elia’s “Hack The Grid 2025.” We confronted a critical challenge: an 8-year wait for new grid hardware, by developing a leaderboard-topping machine learning model that allows operators to safely push existing infrastructure to its absolute limits. Here’s how we did it. AI Governance Secure AI Where are we with the AI Act and what does this mean for your AI governance and compliance efforts? EU Regulators are considering a Stop-the-Clock on the implementation of the European Union AI Act. Does this mean you should halt your AI governance efforts? 
 Tl;dr: The EU AI Act’s obligations for General Purpose AI models and high-risk AI systems are impending, yet legal uncertainty arises as crucial compliance tools are delayed. Despite ""Stop-the-Clock"" talks, halting AI governance is ill-advised. Risks are here now, future compliance is vital, and ethical AI simply leads to better products. Proactive steps in AI literacy, AI governance, and keeping track of relevant guidelines and standards are crucial for businesses to navigate the evolving landscape.

Simply use one of our travel search engines to scan for prices gathered from hundreds of travel sites. KAYAK’s search results pages have loads of filter options to help you find deals, discover exactly what you’re looking for and make booking seamless. Plus, there’s no extra fee from KAYAK. What makes KAYAK a great travel app? On the KAYAK app for iOS and Android you’ll find all the great travel offers found on the website and much more. There are special mobile rates and app only deals that allow you to save even more money. Plus, you can get notifications straight to your phone letting you know when prices for your next trip have dropped. But the KAYAK app is much more than just a travel app. Use the Trips function to manage your travel itinerary and get up to date status alerts on flights, check-in changes and to store your boarding pass. Even if you’re in the middle of nowhere on your travels, you can still access your travel notes via Trips, as no internet connection is required. How can I use KAYAK to manage my travel bookings? KAYAK Trips creates a travel itinerary for you that will give you flight status alerts, can be shared with friends and more. Simply forward your booking confirmations to trips@kayak.com or use the KAYAK app and sync your email account to keep all your travel plans organized in one app, even if you didn’t book with KAYAK. You can share your holiday plans with friends and family and also check out your travel stats for past vacations, like how far you’ve traveled, your most popular cities and how many times you’ve traveled around the world.

Your data is safe and secure with us and you won’t have to re-enter credit card info when booking future trips. If you want to make changes or cancel bookings, then you should contact the travel provider, which is provided on the booking confirmation. What are KAYAK Price Alerts? Instead of manually checking back in on the price of your next flight or stay, let KAYAK do the hard work for you with KAYAK Price Alerts. Once you’ve saved your search, our data will determine how the price will rise or fluctuate over the coming days. You’ll then get a push notification letting you know when’s the perfect time to book. Search flights , hotels , rental cars , travel guides and more with KAYAK. KAYAK searches hundreds of other travel sites at once to get you the information you need to make the right decisions.","0"

I usually enjoy planning my family travels. I feel like beginning the planning is like starting the trip. With a very limited time period and the wanting to accommodate the needs of teenaged grandchildren and grandparents in our eighties, I felt there was no room for error. Working closely with Julia produced an exciting, comprehensive experience none of us will ever forget. Our expectations and needs were fulfilled, under the guidance of Julia’s patient, kind expertise. Paul, UK 23/02/2025 My Rough Guides Expert experience was 1st Class. From my initial thoughts on where i'd like to go in India to the comprehensive schedule with accomodation, transport, driver, guides and timings developed and agfreed between myself and Julie Clark at Indian Stories. My adventure was fulfiling, ticked all the boxes, ensured my safety and well being throughout. As a solo traveller, age 61, it was important to feel fully supported. Keith, UK 31/01/2025 Julie from Rough Guides put together an itinerary for the two of us travelling around India for four weeks. We both tweaked it until we were both completely happy. It was a wonderful experience, and Julie's depth of knowledge and attention to detail made it a most amazing month for both of us. Everything worked like clockwork, the transport, hotels, guides, etc, were all spot on. If you are planning a trip to one of the most wonderful countries on the planet, simply contact Rough Guides, they will put you on to Julie, and she will do the rest.

It's recommended to serve it with a glass of cold beer on the side. Vavishka Gilan Province, Iran Vavishka is a hearty Iranian stew originating from the northern regions of Iran, particularly popular in the Gilan province along the Caspian Sea coast. This dish is distinguished by its rich blend of herbs, legumes, and tender meat, usually lamb or beef, simmered together to create a thick, flavorful stew that reflects the agricultural abundance and culinary heritage of the area. Vavishka embodies the region’s preference for fresh, green ingredients and the use of local herbs such as parsley, cilantro, and chives, which impart a distinctive aroma and vibrant character to the dish. The history of vavishka is closely connected to the rural communities of northern Iran, where stews have long been a staple due to their ability to combine available produce and proteins into nourishing meals. The dish developed as a way to utilize the region’s fertile land and diverse herbs, integrating them with pulses like chickpeas or white beans to create a filling and balanced dish. Over generations, vavishka has been passed down through families, adapting slightly with local tastes and ingredient availability, but maintaining its essential qualities of freshness and depth of flavor. Preparation of vavishka involves slow-cooking ground meat with an assortment of finely chopped herbs and legumes in a seasoned broth. The herbs are often sautéed before being added, helping to release their oils and intensify the stew’s fragrance. The legumes contribute to the stew’s texture and nutritional value, thickening the broth as they soften. The cooking process allows the flavors to meld over several hours, resulting in a stew that is rich, aromatic, and comforting. Vavishka is traditionally served with steamed rice, which balances the intensity of the stew and provides a complete meal. Fossolia Ethiopia Fossolia is a traditional dish made with green beans as the primary ingredient. Apart from the green beans, the dish also contains onions, garlic, ginger, carrots, and tomatoes. Fossolia is cooked for a long time until the liquids evaporate and the vegetables become very tender. Once cooked, the dish is seasoned with ground pepper, then served as a side dish or on a piece of injera flatbread. Pèpè soup Cameroon Pèpè soup is a traditional soup with intense aromas, made with njansa nut as the main ingredient. It is also popular in Nigeria and throughout West Africa. A spicy nut known as njansa is the key ingredient in pèpè soup, acting as a thickener and giving the soup its signature flavors. Other ingredients include meat or fish, garlic, ginger, hot peppers, onions, and water. The soup can be served on its own or it can be paired with yams, rice, and plantains when served as a main dish. Ciğer sarma Turkiye Ciğer sarma is a dish consisting of lamb liver and rice mixed with pine nuts, currants, onions, and spices wrapped in softened lamb caul fat. The dish is baked until golden brown, with the caul fat keeping the filling moist and enhancing the flavor. Traditionally served during special occasions, ciğer sarma reflects the culinary heritage of the region, combining aromatic ingredients and meticulous preparation. Its presentation, with the caul fat enclosing the spiced filling, makes it both visually appealing and deliciously satisfying. This dish is a hallmark of Edirne's rich gastronomic culture. Kaleh pacheh Iran Kaleh pacheh is a hearty and richly flavored Iranian offal dish that originates from various regions across Iran, notably popular in cities like Tehran, Isfahan, and Tabriz. The dish is composed primarily of sheep’s head (kaleh) and trotters (pacheh), slow-cooked for hours until the meat becomes tender and the broth develops a deep, gelatinous texture. Kaleh pacheh is traditionally consumed as a breakfast or early morning meal, valued for its nourishing qualities and robust taste. This dish has been part of Iranian cuisine for centuries, reflecting a culinary tradition of utilizing all parts of the animal to create wholesome and sustaining food. The slow-cooking process extracts rich flavors and nutrients from the bones and connective tissues, resulting in a soup that is both filling and restorative. Kaleh pacheh has historically been favored by laborers and those seeking a substantial meal to start the day, and over time, it has become a cultural emblem of Iranian gastronomy. Preparation of kaleh pacheh requires meticulous cleaning of the sheep’s head and trotters, followed by a long simmering process that can take several hours. Spices such as turmeric, cinnamon, and dried lime are commonly added to infuse the broth with aromatic warmth. The resulting soup is served piping hot, often accompanied by fresh bread, raw herbs, lemon wedges, and sometimes chili for those who prefer an extra kick. Diners typically enjoy the tender meat alongside the rich broth, using bread to soak up the flavorful liquid. South Texas-Style Barbecue Texas, United States of America South Texas-style barbecue is an American regional barbecue style in which it's all about barbacoa and cow heads – they are cooked in a pit lined with stones or bricks, and then a mesquite fire is started in the bottom of the pit. Agave leaves are placed on top of the coals, and the heads (or other meat) are placed on top of it, while the leaves are folded over before the lid is placed over the pit. The resulting meat is so tender that it falls off the bone (or off the skull), and it is then served by the pound with sided such as onions, tortillas, cilantro, and various salsas. This barbecue style also uses cabrito – young goats that are spit-roasted or cooked over coals. Graham cracker United States of America Graham cracker is a sweet American cracker made with graham flour and usually flavored with honey or cinnamon. The crackers date back to the early 1880s, when they were made with graham flour, lard or shortening, salt, molasses, and oil. They were invented by Sylvester Graham, a Presbyterian minister who introduced them in hopes to end masturbation – he believed that a radical vegetarian diet without white flour and spices would end lustful behaviour. Nowadays, the crackers are used in the preparation of s'mores, while graham cracker crumbs are used for pies, cheesecakes, and moon pies. In the Philippines, an icebox cake known as mango float uses graham crackers, cream, and mangoes. Bolo de macaxeira Brazil Bolo de macaxeira is a moist, dense cake from Brazil made with grated cassava root, coconut flakes, sugar, eggs, butter, and coconut milk, often served as a comforting dessert or snack. It is known for its rich texture and slightly chewy consistency. The preparation begins with peeling and finely grating fresh cassava, which is then mixed with sugar, coconut flakes, eggs, melted butter, coconut milk, milk, and baking powder to form a thick batter. The mixture is poured into a greased baking pan, often topped with coconut flakes, and baked slowly until the exterior forms a golden crust while the interior stays moist and slightly custardy. The cake’s distinctive texture comes from the natural starch in the cassava, which gives it a dense, pudding-like consistency that sets it apart from flour-based cakes. Bolo de macaxeira is usually served at room temperature, often cut into squares or slices and enjoyed with coffee or tea. It is a common feature at family gatherings, afternoon snacks, and local celebrations, and pairs well with creamy accompaniments such as cheese spreads or a drizzle of condensed milk. Sanjacobo Spain Sanjacobo is a Spanish dish consisting of ham and cheese enclosed within a coating, typically made by sandwiching a slice of cheese between ham slices, coating the layered package in flour, beaten egg, and breadcrumbs, and then frying it until crisp. It has become a familiar item in Spanish home cooking and tapas menus, especially when people want something quick yet satisfying. Its roots are not definitively documented, though legends tie it to the Camino de Santiago, where it is said to have been offered in inns to pilgrims, or that its name honors Saint James—“San Jacobo”—possibly as a way to distinguish Christian from non-Christian diners in past centuries. Yet the first recorded mentions of the name “sanjacobo” date from the late 20th century, appearing in Andalusian and Spanish cooking publications. Over the decades, it has been likened to the French cordon bleu and regarded as a simpler, domestic version of stuffed and fried meat dishes, becoming popular especially in the 1980s and 1990s. To prepare it, one places a slice of melting cheese—often Emmental, Gouda, or another that melts cleanly—between two slices of cooked ham (which may be square or rectangular). The edges are aligned and sometimes pressed to help seal the filling. The resulting “sandwich” is then dredged in flour, dipped in beaten egg, and coated in breadcrumbs. Some cooks use two layers of coating to ensure a crisp exterior. Once coated, it is fried in oil—often olive oil — at a moderate temperature for a short time on each side until the exterior is golden and the cheese inside has melted. The excess oil is drained off before serving. What defines San Jacobo is its crisp, golden crust and a melted, creamy cheese interior, both enclosed by savory ham. Its simplicity allows variations: some versions add mustard or honey to the interior, or use ham of higher quality (such as Serrano or Iberian) to elevate the flavor. It is typically served hot, often as a main course or in tapas form, accompanied by a salad or fried potatoes to offset its richness. Because of its fried nature and melting interior, it pairs well with crisp, acidic elements—such as a light salad with vinaigrette—or with a dry white wine or a light red that can cut through fat. In many Spanish homes, it remains a go-to for dinner, comfort meals, or when a simple, filling dish is desired. Zī rán yáng ròu Xinjiang, China Zī rán yáng ròu is a Chinese stir-fried lamb dish seasoned primarily with cumin, chili, and garlic, originating from Xinjiang. The region has long relied on lamb and mutton as staple proteins, and its cuisine reflects influences from Central Asia and the Silk Road, where spices like cumin were introduced and became central to local cooking. Its development is tied to the pastoral lifestyle of Xinjiang communities, where herding sheep and goats provided a natural base for the diet. When cumin and other spices made their way into the region through trade, they blended seamlessly with the strong flavors of lamb, creating a preparation that soon became emblematic of Xinjiang cooking. As Chinese cities grew more cosmopolitan and regional cuisines spread beyond their origins, zī rán yáng ròu gained popularity across the country, representing both the unique flavors of the northwest and the diversity of Chinese gastronomy as a whole. To prepare the dish, lamb is cut into thin slices or small cubes, often marinated briefly with soy sauce, rice wine, or ginger to tenderize the meat and balance its gaminess. It is then stir-fried quickly over high heat with whole cumin seeds or ground cumin, dried chili peppers, onions, and garlic. Some versions include bell peppers, scallions, or celery, which add texture and contrast to the richness of the lamb. The method emphasizes high heat and rapid cooking, locking in the meat’s juices while coating it with the fragrance of spices. Today, zī rán yáng ròu is eaten in Xinjiang with flatbreads or rice, fitting into the broader diet of the region, while in other parts of China it is often paired with plain steamed rice or noodles to balance its strong, aromatic profile. It is a common feature at barbecue stalls, casual eateries, and increasingly at restaurants abroad that showcase regional Chinese cooking, allowing it to be enjoyed both as a quick street-side dish and as part of a larger meal shared among friends and family. Qīngzhēng yú Guangdong, China Qīngzhēng yú is a classic Chinese steamed fish dish originating from southern China, especially associated with Cantonese cuisine, where emphasis on freshness and natural flavors defines much of the region’s cooking. It is built around the principle of highlighting the fish itself, often using freshwater species such as mandarin fish, carp, or sea bass, prepared with minimal seasoning to preserve its delicate texture and subtle sweetness. Steaming fish in this way has been a favored technique in Chinese kitchens for centuries, reflecting both culinary values and cultural beliefs: fish is a symbol of abundance and prosperity, and presenting it whole at the table signifies completeness and unity, making the dish a staple of family banquets and festive gatherings. Over time, it became a hallmark of Cantonese fine dining and a showcase of a chef’s skill, as achieving the right balance of timing, temperature, and seasoning requires precision and restraint. Preparation of qīngzhēng yú begins with selecting a very fresh fish, often kept alive until the moment of cooking. The fish is cleaned and scored, then placed on a plate with aromatics such as ginger and scallions, sometimes with a splash of Shaoxing wine to reduce any fishiness. It is steamed gently until just cooked through, ensuring the flesh stays tender and moist. After steaming, the fish is topped with thinly sliced scallions, cilantro, and sometimes chili, followed by a drizzle of hot oil to release the aromatics and a final pour of light soy sauce. The cooking method is straightforward but demands careful timing, as overcooking can easily ruin the texture. Qīngzhēng yú is often served whole, head and tail intact, symbolizing good fortune and continuity, particularly during Lunar New Year celebrations or significant family meals. Its clean and subtle taste makes it a centerpiece dish rather than an overpowering one, and it pairs well with plain steamed rice, stir-fried greens, or mild tofu dishes. In Cantonese cuisine, it is frequently served as one of the main courses in a multi-dish banquet, where its lightness balances richer, heavier flavors. Schmaltz Israel Schmaltz is rendered poultry fat, most commonly made from chicken, and used as a cooking fat in Ashkenazi Jewish cuisine. It appears in many dishes that rely on animal fat for flavor, especially in communities that did not use dairy fats in meat meals and therefore needed a reliable, shelf-stable fat source. Its use became established in Jewish populations across Central and Eastern Europe where chickens and geese were widely kept, and rendering their fat offered an efficient way to make use of all parts of the bird in times when access to other fats could be limited or costly. Preparation involves collecting raw chicken skin and fatty trimmings, cutting them into small pieces, and cooking them slowly over low heat until the fat melts out and the solid pieces turn crisp. The liquid fat is strained and stored for later use, while the browned leftovers, known as gribenes, are often eaten as a snack or garnish. Schmaltz has a distinct aroma and flavor that influence the dishes it is used in, and its high smoke point makes it suitable for frying onions, cooking matzah balls, enriching doughs, or flavoring soups and potato dishes. It is eaten in Jewish households and delicatessens in many countries, incorporated into foods such as chopped liver, potato kugel, matzah brei, and fried dishes, and it pairs well with onions, poultry, hearty vegetables, and breads that absorb savory fats. It is often served with simple beverages like tea or cold water alongside rich dishes, though in modern contexts it appears in both traditional and contemporary cooking where its concentrated poultry flavor is appreciated. Côtes du Jura Jura, France Côtes du Jura is an appellation from the Jura region in eastern France, covering a long and narrow stretch of vineyards that run along the western edge of the Jura mountains. It is known for producing red, white, and rosé wines as well as oxidative styles that are characteristic of the area, with permitted grape varieties including Savagnin, Chardonnay, Poulsard, Trousseau, and Pinot Noir. Its development is tied to longstanding viticulture in the region, shaped by the geological setting of marl and limestone soils and by vineyard practices that were already established when the appellation system was formalized in the mid-twentieth century to organize the diverse wine styles produced across Jura. Winemaking methods vary according to grape type and the style being made; whites may be produced in a non-oxidative manner similar to other French regions, or aged under a layer of yeast known as the voile for extended periods, a process that creates the nutty and saline profile associated with some Jura wines. Reds are typically lighter in color and body, often fermented and aged in a way that preserves the fruit character of Poulsard and Trousseau, and rosés are made through short macerations that highlight the naturally pale pigments of local grapes. A notable aspect of Côtes du Jura is the wide stylistic range permitted within a single appellation, allowing producers to bottle oxidative wines, classic whites, and light reds under the same designation, which is less common in many French wine regions. It is consumed throughout France and increasingly found abroad in restaurants and wine shops where Jura wines have gained attention, served with cheeses from the region such as Comté, poultry dishes with cream sauces, charcuterie, mushrooms, freshwater fish, and lighter red meats; in international settings it pairs well with nut-forward dishes, roasted vegetables, and foods that benefit from either the crispness of the non-oxidative wines or the savory depth of the oxidative styles. Attiéké Ivory Coast Attiéké is a cassava-based product from Côte d’Ivoire made by fermenting, granulating, and steaming cassava pulp until it forms light, couscous-like grains. It is considered one of the core staples of Ivorian cuisine and is produced both in households and by specialized cooperatives that prepare it on a larger scale. Although it resembles couscous in appearance, its taste and aroma come from cassava fermentation, giving it characteristics distinct from cereal-based grains. Its development is linked to the culinary practices of the Akan peoples of southern Côte d’Ivoire, especially the Ebrié and Adjoukrou communities. Cassava became a major staple in the region after its introduction from South America in the post-Columbian era. Local groups adapted processing methods to transform cassava into stable, edible products, which was necessary due to cassava’s natural toxicity in raw form. Fermented cassava preparations evolved over generations, and attiéké emerged as a uniquely Ivorian product that spread through coastal settlements and later across the country. As urbanization increased in the twentieth century, attiéké became widely commercialized, enabling consistent production and distribution throughout West Africa and into diaspora communities in Europe and North America. Preparation begins by peeling and washing fresh cassava, then grating it into a fine pulp. The pulp is placed in bags to drain and ferment for one to three days, depending on climate and desired acidity. After fermentation, the pulp is squeezed to remove excess liquid and broken into small granules by rubbing it between the hands or using woven sieves. The granules are lightly oiled or moistened and steamed until fluffy. Modern commercial production follows the same steps but with controlled fermentation and mechanical granulation to maintain uniform texture. The finished product is neutral, slightly tangy, and absorbs the flavors of the dishes served with it. Variations exist, such as garba-style attiéké for street food or finer, more delicate versions made for family meals and celebrations. Some regions produce attiéké with distinct acidity levels or grain sizes, giving subtle differences across Côte d’Ivoire. Attiéké is eaten throughout Côte d’Ivoire at all times of day and appears in both home cooking and street food. It is often served with grilled fish, fried fish, or chicken, accompanied by raw tomato and onion salad, hot pepper, and a drizzle of oil. It also pairs well with stews, sauces, and braised meats. Beverages commonly served with it include bissap, ginger juice, beer, palm wine, or cold soft drinks, which complement its slightly tangy flavor and the often spicy or savory dishes served alongside it. Olho-de-sogra Brazil Olho-de-sogra is a Brazilian dessert made from sweetened coconut filling encased in a dried plum, often finished with a coating of sugar or syrup. Its name, which translates to “mother-in-law’s eye,” reflects the playful and humorous naming tradition found in many Brazilian sweets. The candy is a staple at festive occasions, especially birthdays, weddings, and holiday celebrations, where it is presented alongside other bite-sized confections such as brigadeiros and beijinhos. Olho-de-sogra was created sometime in the 20th century, and gained popularity at social gatherings and family celebrations. The preparation is straightforward but requires attention to achieve the right balance of sweetness and texture. Grated coconut is cooked gently with sweetened condensed milk and butter until it thickens into a soft, pliable mixture known as beijinho. Once cooled, small portions of this filling are shaped and stuffed into pitted prunes, which provide a contrasting chewy texture and a hint of tartness to balance the sweetness of the coconut. The filled prunes are sometimes rolled in granulated sugar or brushed with syrup for a glossy finish. Some variations include a small clove pressed into the top for added aroma or a light dusting of powdered sugar for presentation. Olho-de-sogra is most often served at room temperature, arranged on decorative trays during celebrations and family gatherings. It pairs well with coffee, tea, or dessert wines, whose bitterness or acidity complements the richness of the confection. Yùní Fujian, China Yùní is a soft taro paste dessert made primarily in Fujian and Teochew regions, prepared from steamed taro mashed with sugar and fat until smooth and dense. It comes from areas where taro has been a common crop for centuries and where cooks developed methods to turn it into soft, sweetened pastes for banquets and home meals, especially in southern coastal communities that valued taro as both a staple and a dessert ingredient. The dish formed as households began steaming local taro, removing excess moisture, and blending it with lard or other fats to create a consistent texture that could hold its shape while remaining delicate on the palate; some places later incorporated dairy or neutral oils, but the core method stayed centered on slow, even mixing over gentle heat. Preparation involves peeling and steaming taro until fully soft, mashing it while still warm, adding sugar and fat in stages, and stirring until the paste becomes smooth and slightly glossy; in many kitchens it is then shaped into a mound or served warm directly from the pot. Sweetened red beans, gingko nuts, or dried longan may be added for contrast, and the taro itself provides a mild earthy sweetness that depends heavily on the starch content of the specific variety grown in Fujian and Guangdong, making the choice of local taro an important factor. Yùní is eaten at home, in banquet dishes, and in dessert shops, often served warm or at room temperature and paired with mild teas, light soups, or plain congee-style sides that balance its sweetness, while some people enjoy it with unsweetened herbal tea to offset its richness. Charoset Israel Charoset is a sweet relish made for the Passover Seder in Jewish communities, prepared from fruits, nuts and spices, with the exact composition varying widely across regions. It appears on the Seder plate and is eaten during specific parts of the ritual meal, most notably with matzah as part of the prescribed order of the evening. Its development reflects the foods available to Jewish communities in different parts of the world, and written references from rabbinic texts point to mixtures based on fruits such as dates, figs, apples and grapes, combined with nuts and wine, with later regional adaptations shaped by local crops and culinary habits. Preparation depends on the community: Ashkenazi versions often use apples, walnuts, sweet wine and cinnamon mixed into a coarse or finely chopped blend; Sephardi and Mizrahi versions may use dates, raisins, figs, almonds, and grape syrup or wine, sometimes forming a thick paste that is cooked or left raw depending on custom; Yemeni charoset (dukka) frequently includes dates, sesame, vinegar and spices ground into a dense mixture. A notable aspect is the wide variation in texture and flavor between communities, which makes charoset one of the most regionally diverse components of the Seder meal despite its shared purpose. It is eaten during Passover Seders worldwide, placed on matzah in combination with other ritual elements, and it pairs naturally with the foods of the Seder table such as bitter herbs, roasted dishes, eggs and matzah, and it can also accompany tea or sweet wine when sampled outside the ritual context. Piliç Topkapı Turkiye Piliç Topkapı is a classic Turkish chicken dish rooted in Ottoman culinary traditions, named after the Topkapı Palace in Istanbul. It features chicken, typically boneless pieces like thighs, stuffed with a savory rice pilaf. The stuffing is a flavorful mix of pine nuts, currants, onions, and spices such as cinnamon, allspice, and black pepper, creating a balance of savory and subtly sweet flavors. The stuffed chicken is secured with toothpicks, brushed with tomato paste and yogurt, and baked until golden and tender. It is usually served with rice pilaf on the side, accompanied by roasted vegetables or a simple salad. Ānhuà hēichá Anhua, China Ānhuà hēichá is a type of dark tea produced in Anhua County, a region known for its humid climate, rich soils, and mist-covered mountains that create ideal conditions for tea cultivation and fermentation. This tea belongs to the category of fermented or post-fermented teas, meaning it undergoes microbial transformation after initial processing, which develops its characteristic deep color, earthy aroma, and mellow flavor over time. It has been an integral part of daily life in central and western China for centuries and is particularly associated with the tea cultures of minority regions in western China and along historic trade routes. The making of dark tea in Anhua can be traced back more than a thousand years, when it was produced as a staple beverage for long-distance trade to Tibet, Xinjiang, and Inner Mongolia, where its rich, restorative qualities were valued in cold climates and high altitudes. It became a key commodity along the Ancient Tea Horse Road, often compressed into bricks for easier transport and storage, and was frequently exchanged for horses and livestock. Over time, Anhua dark tea gained a reputation not only as a practical beverage but also as one linked to health and vitality, and it was widely consumed by herders, nomadic peoples, and farmers in remote areas. The production of Ānhuà hēichá is a complex process that sets it apart from other Chinese teas. Fresh tea leaves are withered, pan-fired, and rolled before undergoing a unique fermentation stage, where controlled moisture and temperature encourage the growth of specific microorganisms. This microbial activity gradually transforms the tea’s chemical composition, deepening its color, softening its astringency, and creating a smooth, rich, and slightly sweet profile. The tea is often aged for months or even years, during which its flavors continue to mature, gaining complexity and depth. It is commonly formed into bricks, logs, or discs, which not only enhance aging but also reflect its historical role as a traded good. Today, Ānhuà hēichá remains popular in western and northern China and has gained recognition among tea enthusiasts worldwide for its complexity and longevity. It is often brewed in clay pots or large kettles and served in small cups, sometimes blended with milk or salt in Tibetan and Mongolian regions. It pairs well with fatty meats, dairy-based foods, and rich stews, as its earthy, slightly sweet flavor cuts through richness and complements hearty dishes. Trending Foods 1 Beef and Guinness stew Ireland Beef and Guinness stew is a slow-cooked meat dish from Ireland that brings together the depth of stout beer with the richness of braised beef. Its roots are connected to rural cooking, where hearty stews were a practical way to transform modest cuts of beef and simple root vegetables into a warming and filling meal. The introduction of Guinness stout into the preparation reflects Ireland’s brewing heritage, adding both flavor and character to an otherwise straightforward preparation of beef, onions, carrots, and potatoes. The method of making this stew is centered on patience. Beef is first browned to build flavor, then simmered gently in a mixture of stock and Guinness until tender. Vegetables are added, sometimes in stages to maintain texture, and the stew thickens naturally as the starch from the potatoes mingles with the broth. The stout itself mellows during cooking, leaving behind notes of roasted malt and a slight bitterness that balances the sweetness of onions and carrots. In some variations, herbs like thyme or bay leaf are included, and cooks may thicken the sauce further with flour or add a small splash of Worcestershire sauce for extra depth. Today, beef and Guinness stew is eaten widely in Ireland and has become a hallmark of Irish pubs around the world, particularly during gatherings such as St. Patrick’s Day. It is most often served with bread like soda bread to soak up the sauce, or with mashed potatoes for an even heartier meal. Pairings are naturally straightforward: a pint of Guinness itself is the most iconic accompaniment, though other robust ales or even red wines also complement its rich, slow-cooked flavors. 2 Vori-vori Paraguay Vori-vori is a soup from Paraguay made with small balls of cornmeal and cheese cooked in a broth that often includes chicken, vegetables, and herbs, and it is recognized as a staple dish across the country’s rural and urban regions. Its development is linked to the long-standing use of corn and poultry in Guaraní and later mixed culinary practices documented in household cooking records and regional accounts from the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, where corn-based doughs were shaped into dense dumplings to stretch ingredients during periods of limited supply. Preparation involves mixing finely ground cornmeal with grated cheese and a small amount of fat or broth to form a firm dough, shaping it into small spheres, and poaching them gently in a simmering broth until they swell and soften; the soup is seasoned with onions, garlic, parsley, and occasionally peppers, and served as soon as the dumplings reach a uniform texture. A notable feature is the density of the dumplings, which absorb broth while retaining their structure, giving the dish a thickened consistency without flour or other thickeners. Vori-vori is eaten throughout Paraguay in home kitchens, rural gatherings, and small restaurants, often as a main meal during cooler weather, and it pairs well with simple accompaniments such as mandioca, fresh salads, mild cheeses, herbal teas, and lightly flavored nonalcoholic beverages, with some households serving it alongside light beers or local wines depending on the occasion. 3 Kontosouvli Greece Kontosouvli is a traditional dish consisting of large pieces of pork marinated in a mixture of herbs and spices, then skewered and slowly cooked on a rotisserie, much like a gyro or souvlaki. The marinade often contains ingredients such as garlic, oregano, thyme, rosemary, paprika, olive oil, lemon juice, and red wine. After marinating, the meat is threaded onto a large skewer and roasted over an open flame, which results in a rich and flavorful outer crust with a juicy, tender interior. The cooked meat is typically served in thick slices, often accompanied by pita bread, tzatziki sauce, and horiatiki salad, among other possible accompaniments. It was traditionally prepared for Easter, but today it can be found on the menus of Greek tavernas throughout the year. 4 Komplet lepinja Zlatibor District, Serbia This delicacy consists of a traditional flatbread (lepinja) that is cut in half, coated in thick cream (kajmak), and topped with an egg. The combination is shortly baked and should be doused with a mixture of warm meat drippings, which is locally known as pretop. Komplet can be loosely translated as with everything in it, and is traditionally associated with Užice and Zlatibor. It is believed to have originated sometime before WWII, and the name was officially registered by Dragan Lazić, a current owner of the bakery Kod Šuljage in Užice. Although it is nutritious and highly caloric, the dish is commonly enjoyed for breakfast and is best paired with a glass of yogurt or sour milk on the side. For the most authentic experience, it is recommended to eat it with your hands. 5 Tajarin al tartufo bianco d'Alba Province of Cuneo, Italy Tajarin al tartufo bianco is a pasta dish flavored with the regional star - tartufo bianco d'Alba. This simple dish consists of handmade tajarin (also spelled as taglierini and tagliolini) pasta flavored with butter, pepper, and freshly grated white truffles. Although truffles bring more than enough flavor, a sprinkle of Parmigiano is often used to finish this delicacy, which becomes even more decadent if paired with a glass of dry red wine. 6 Salsa ocopa Arequipa, Peru Salsa ocopa is a popular Peruvian sauce originating from Arequipa. It is made with queso fresco, aji amarillo chilis, milk, and huacatay, also known as Peruvian black mint, giving the sauce a unique flavor. The salsa is traditionally served with boiled potatoes, but it can also accompany pasta dishes, meat, fried yucca, hard-boiled eggs, or tequeños. 7 Pastel de Belém Belém, Portugal Pastel de Belém is a traditional egg custard tart and a predecessor to the famous pastel de nata. The tarts are made with a pastry shell that's filled with a combination of milk, eggs, sugar, lemon, and cinnamon. The first recipe for pastel de Belém dates back to 1837 when it was produced by the monks of the Jerónimos monastery. Only the custard tarts produced at the Fábrica Pastéis de Belém can be called pastel de Belém, while all the others, produced by other patisseries in Lisbon are called pastel de nata. Regardless of the name, these tarts can be served hot or cold and in 2009, The Guardian listed pastel de Belém as one of the 50 'best things to eat' in the world. 8 Finiki Lakonias Finiki, Greece This high quality extra virgin olive oil is obtained from Koroneiki (70%), Tsounati (25%), and Asprolia (5%) olives cultivated in the Finiki area of Lakonia prefecture. This oil owes its unique organoleptic properties to the special microclimate of the area and its chalky soils. Its aroma is described as reminiscent of fresh cut grass and its taste is quite fruity and peppery. The olives are handpicked or gathered using rakes when the olives are ripe and yellowy green to violet in color. They are immediately transferred to olive mills where the oil is extracted through a mechanical cold pressing method. The final product is a greenish-yellow olive oil with some golden tones that can be consumed raw, used as a dressing for various Greek salads, or used for cooking. 9 Sate kambing Indonesia Sate kambing is a traditional dish and a type of satay prepared with goat or mutton as the main ingredient. The meat is cut into chunks or cubes and it's marinated in a combination of ingredients such as kecap manis (sweet soy sauce), galangal, ground shallots, pineapple juice, and (often) chili peppers. After it's been marinated, the meat is placed on skewers that are larger and thicker than the ones used for chicken satay as the texture and thickness of mutton or goat is tougher than chicken. The skewers for sate kambing are usually made from bamboo. The meat is grilled, then served with kecap manis sauce, peanut sauce, or chili sauce, consisting of shallots, bird eye chili peppers, and kecap manis. Some like to eat sate kambing with steamed rice or rice cakes on the side. This type of sate is especially popular in Java. 10 Conchitas a la parmesana Peru Conchitas a la parmesana is a traditional dish that's served as an appetizer. It consists of scallops that are topped with grated parmesan, then placed under the broiler for a few minutes. When served, the cheese should be bubbling, but the scallops will remain almost raw. The ingredients used for the dish include scallops, Worcestershire sauce, lime juice, butter, salt, pepper, and grated parmesan cheese. The dish is served immediately, while still piping hot, ideally with lime wedges on the side. 11 Pappardelle al cinghiale Tuscany, Italy Pappardelle is a famous Tuscan pasta variety. When paired with ragù di cinghiale (made with wild boar), they become one of the region's best gastronomic experiences. Unlike classic ragù, the one prepared with wild boar has an intense, much stronger flavor achieved by long, slow simmering in a rich sauce of tomatoes and red wine. The tender meat paired with fresh egg pasta is a combination full of flavors and tradition in every single bite - rich and delicious, topped with a generous amount of chopped fresh parsley and a sprinkle of Parmigiano, pappardelle al ragù di cinghiale make a perfect, comforting winter dish, especially when paired with a glass of Tuscan red wine. 12 Pizza Napoletana Naples, Italy Italy’s most emblematic culinary creation, the genuine pizza Napoletana is made with just a few simple ingredients and prepared in only two variations – marinara, the basic Neapolitan pizza topped with a tomato-based sauce flavored with garlic and oregano, and margherita, which is topped with tomatoes, mozzarella, and fresh basil leaves, a delicious combination whose colors are said to represent the Italian flag. The crust is very thin at the base, and the dough puffs up on the sides, which results in airy crust that should have typical charred 'leopard spots' if baked properly. The origins of this iconic Neapolitan dish can be traced to the early 1700s, when what we know today as pizza marinara was first described by Italian chef, writer, and philosopher Vincenzo Corrado in his treatise on the eating habits of the people of Naples. Almost 200 years later, in 1889, the premier Neapolitan master pizzaiolo Raffaele Esposito added mozzarella to the mix and invented the margherita, which is now generally cited as the first modern pizza. Originally dubbed la pizza tricolore, Esposito’s creation is said to have been made in honor of and named after Margherita of Savoy, the Queen consort of the Kingdom of Italy, who was visiting Naples at the time. In 2010, as one of Italy’s most popular foods worldwide, pizza Napoletana was officially recognized by the European Union and granted the designation of Traditional Specialty Guaranteed. And remember, a good pizza Napoletana doesn't need any additions other than the designated toppings. 13 Arroz tapado Peru Arroz tapado is a Peruvian dish that is easy to prepare and inexpensive. It is made with rice, carrots, ground beef, tomato paste, onions, garlic, black olives, and chopped hard-boiled eggs. This dish is layered, usually in a way where rice is on the bottom and on the top, with the other ingredients sandwiched in the middle layer. Once assembled, arroz tapado is garnished with parsley and served with green salads, plantains, or avocado slices on the side, if desired. 14 Pollo a la brasa Lima, Peru Pollo a la brasa is a popular Peruvian dish consisting of crunchy and juicy charcoal-grilled chicken that is traditionally served with French fries and salads. Today, it is one of the most consumed meals in Peru, so much that 27 million Peruvians eat it daily. The dish was first invented in Lima in the 1950s, when it was seasoned only with salt, but nowadays the chicken is often marinated in a special combination of ingredients, usually consisting of vinegar, salt, pepper, rosemary, chili, and dark beer. 15 Aji criollo Peru Aji criollo or salsa de aji is a spicy Peruvian salsa prepared with a combination of yellow aji chili peppers and oil. The sauce is usually pleasantly spicy, but it can also be extremely hot and spicy, so one should be careful when tasting it for the first time. The sauce is traditionally used as an accompaniment to various meat and fish dishes, but it's also often used as a dip for french fries and tequeños. Although it shares the name with an Ecuadorian sauce, those two differ significantly, both in appearance (Ecuadorian version is green), and in the method of preparation and ingredients used. 16 Lechon Philippines Lechon, derived from a Spanish word for roasted suckling pig is one of the most popular dishes in the Philippines. The slowly-roasted suckling pig is usually stuffed with lemongrass, tamarind, garlic, onions, and chives, and is then roasted on a large bamboo spit over an open fire. It is traditionally served whole on a platter, at celebrations and festive events such as weddings and Christmas. Once the meat is properly roasted and falls off the bone, people tend to eat every part of the pig, and the crispy, reddish-brown, crackling skin is especially beloved. Lechon is often served with a thick and rich liver sauce that is cooked with sugar, fresh herbs, and vinegar. If anything is left after the feast, the leftovers are often made into lechon slaw, slowly cooked with vinegar, garlic, and liver sauce for that extra bit of flavor. Apart from the Philippines, the dish is especially popular in countries such as Cuba, Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic, and Spain. Some famous chefs even named lechon the best pig in the world, so it is definitely worth a try. 17 Yufka Turkiye Yufka is a traditional flatbread consisting of flour, water, salt, and olive oil. The unleavened dough is typically rolled with a rolling pin until it develops a paper-thin consistency. It is believed that yufka is an earlier form of phyllo dough. It can be used in the preparation of numerous Turkish pastries, and it is sturdy enough to hold all of the fillings for a shawarma sandwich. In 2016, UNESCO recognized yufka making and sharing culture as an Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity. 18 Chè Vietnam Vietnamese chè dishes include any traditional sweet soup, beverage, pudding, or any other custard-like dessert that is made with a base of either water or coconut cream and served either hot or cold. Other ingredients for making chè include various jellies and fruits, beans and pulses, rice and grains, and even tubers and cereals. It is believed that chè desserts originated in the central region of Vietnam, but today they are widely available throughout the country and prepared in countless variations. Because of their hearty contents like beans and sticky rice, they are a popular snack item commonly sold in plastic cups at Vietnamese grocery stores, while one of the most popular chè varieties prepared at home is the so-called chè đậu trắng. This white bean and rice pudding flavored with coconut syrup is traditionally offered at Vietnamese family gatherings celebrating the first birthday of a baby. 19 Quesabirria Tijuana, Mexico Quesabirria is a popular Mexican street food dish, a fusion between birria (a traditional Mexican meat stew) and quesadillas. The dish originates from Tijuana and typically consists of large tortillas filled with birria-style cooked meat (usually beef) and a generous amount of melted cheese. The tortillas are cooked on the stove until the cheese melts and the outside of the tortilla becomes crispy. Quesabirria is often accompanied by a side of broth, or consomé, for dipping, adding another layer of flavor to the dish. 20 Tartufo bianco d'Alba Alba, Italy Tartufo bianco d'Alba is an extremely rare Italian white truffle (lat. Tuber magnatum pico) found in the Alba region from October to December. The truffles grow symbiotically with hazel, poplar, beech, and oak. Their rich flavor and aroma is often described as moldy, earthy, oniony, cheesy, and garlicky. On the inside, these pale cream or brown truffles have a white, marbled, and creamy interior that is riddled with ivory veins. They pair extremely well with cheese, crab, beef, and chicken. Many purists believe that these expensive mushrooms should be used exclusively to top off pasta, risottos, pot roasts, and egg or potato dishes. It's certainly at its best raw - when cooked, this truffle loses all its flavor.

Time Out’s global travel team then narrowed down the list and ranked each street against criteria including food, drink, culture, fun and community spirit.

White #1 +1499 (54%) 133-112-4 in Last 249 NFL Picks NFL TEN @ CLE • Sun 1:00pm CLE -3.5 -110 Spread Picked: Dec 1 @ 10:21am Analysis Both teams are coming off blowout losses at home, but the Browns actually played well enough to win if not for two special teams miscues and a baffling decision to go for it on fourth down on their own 32. Those three plays led to 49ers touchdown drives that combined had the length of one normal TD drive, and the defense really deserved a competitive game at the end. The Titans can't make any such claim, with three offensive TDs in November and two coming after going down 30-10. On the road against a defense that is still playing hard, we can't expect much from Tennessee's offense. The Browns offense didn't have to do much to blow out Miami and Vegas, and this feels similar. Analysis Matchup Betslip R.J. White #1 +1499 (54%) 133-112-4 in Last 249 NFL Picks NFL IND @ JAC • Sun 1:00pm JAC +1.5 -110 Spread Picked: Dec 1 @ 10:32am Analysis The Colts have key injuries on both sides of the ball, with Daniel Jones playing hurt and Sauce Gardner now sidelined. Indy has failed to gain 300 yards in back-to-back games after entering the Week 11 bye as the top offense in football. The Jaguars just closed out a brutal stretch of four road games in five weeks by going 4-1, and the defense is playing well enough that I have Jacksonville rated above average for the first time all year. With Indy's injury concerns, that means this game should be pick 'em at worst, and I wouldn't be surprised if Jacksonville closes favored. Analysis Matchup Betslip R.J. White #1 +1499 (54%) 133-112-4 in Last 249 NFL Picks NFL WAS @ MIN • Sun 1:00pm WAS -1.5 +102 Spread Picked: Dec 1 @ 10:39am Analysis Washington has lost seven straight games, but the Commanders' performance against Denver shows that they're miles ahead of the Vikings right now. Minnesota's defense had every answer for its former QB Sam Darnold, holding Seattle to 219 yards and 3.6 yards per play, and the Vikings still lost 26-0 because they continue to get the worst QB play this century. J.J. McCarthy was just as bad as Max Brosmer in his last start, so I'm not sure it matters who's starting at QB in this matchup, and I don't know how much fight the rest of the team has after seeing what they're getting from the QB position. I moved Minnesota down next to Cleveland in my ratings and that still might be too high. Analysis Matchup Betslip R.J. White #1 +1499 (54%) 133-112-4 in Last 249 NFL Picks NFL MIA @ NYJ • Sun 1:00pm MIA -2.5 -115 Spread Picked: Dec 1 @ 10:48am Analysis The Jets are 4-0-1 ATS in their last five games, but don't mistake that for a legitimate surge in competitiveness. Their wins have largely been marked by return TDs or very short scoring drives off miscues by the other team. Miami has won three straight by winning the turnover battle in each, and they can play a similar game as Atlanta while not essentially giving the Jets 10 free points (on two drives of 3 yards combined). The line makes sense but I think the Dolphins win by 3-7. Analysis Matchup Betslip Larry Hartstein +248 (57%) 16-12 in Last 28 NFL Picks NFL WAS @ MIN • Sun 1:00pm WAS -1 -110 Spread Picked: Dec 1 @ 11:07am Analysis The Commanders gave a spirited performance coming off their bye, losing by one in overtime to Denver. It was Washington's second solid effort in a row. Terry McLaurin's return made a huge difference, as did the presence of Daron Payne and Will Harris on defense. Now Washington visits a reeling Vikings team dealing with internal turmoil. It is unclear at the moment whether J.J. McCarthy and Jayden Daniels will return. Regardless, I like the Commanders to pull out the win.

Wed, Nov 26, 2025 Story 5 ENERGY INTELLIGENCE NEWS India's Push for Climate Finance Sidelined at COP30 COP30 went down as a summit of lost opportunities for India and other developing nations who aimed for more clarity — and scale — on climate finance. Mon, Nov 24, 2025 Explore COP30 > Energy in the Age of Protectionism RISK RESEARCH India: Economic and Energy Demand Outlook Bright, But Clouds Remain If economic reforms continue and investment deepens, India could supplant China as the world’s fastest-growing large economy and energy demand growth engine for the next decade. However, its more services-heavy, domestic focused economic structure will have a major impact on its future energy demand profile.  It also faces hurdles – such as geopolitical tensions, energy import dependency and unfinished reforms – that could weigh on growth.  Overall, Energy Intelligence forecasts that Indian oil demand – which is around 5.8 million b/d – will grow by about 170,000 b/d annually, topping out at 9 million b/d by 2050.  If it can overcome infrastructure shortfalls, natural gas demand will also likely rise significantly.

However, al-Sudani is far from guaranteed another term in office. The positive momentum currently enjoyed by the upstream sector faces key uncertainties. More attractive fiscal terms and political stability will enhance Iraq’s investment appeal, but long-delayed upgrades to midstream infrastructure will be critical to a wider revitalization. TotalEnergies and BP deals have included both gas capture and power projects, supporting Iraq’s rapidly growing demand.
