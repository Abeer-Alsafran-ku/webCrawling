# webCrawling

We have divided this project into 2 phases, 
* Phase 1: Using Hueristic Search Algorithms.
    1. Naive: A non hueristic related search.
    2. A* Search: Search using hueristic functions and functions to calculate the score of each page.
    3. Greedy Best First Search: Using the GBFS to set the score of each page based on a specific hueristic function.
        
* Phase 2: Using Machine Learning Algorithms.
    1. SVM: Support Vector Machine to classify if the body of the page is related to AI or Not.
    2. Naive Bayes: A machile learning algorithm to classify if the page is related to AI or Not.
